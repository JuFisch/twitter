1 The latest example of this view is Norman Cohn’s Warrant for Genocide. The myth of the Jewish world-conspiracy and the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” New York, 1966. The author starts from the implied negation that there is such a thing as Jewish history at all. Jews are in his view “people who . . . lived scattered across Europe from the English Channel to the Volga, with very little in common to them all save their descent from adherents of the Jewish religion” (p. 15). Antisemites, on the contrary, can claim direct and unbroken lineage through space and time from the Middle Ages when “Jews had been seen as agents of Satan, devil-worshippers, demons in human form” (p. 41), and the only qualification to such sweeping generalizations that the learned author of Pursuit of the Millennium sees fit to make is that he deals only with “the deadliest kind of antisemitism, the kind that results in massacre and attempted genocide” (p. 16). The book also tries rather strenuously to prove that “the mass of the German population was never truly fanaticized against the Jews” and that their extermination “was organized and in the main carried out by the professionals of the SD and the SS,” bodies that “did not by any means represent a typical cross-section of German society” (pp. 212 ff.). How one wishes this statement could be squared with the facts! The result is that the work reads as though it were written about forty years ago by an unduly ingenious member of the Verein zur Bekämpfung des Antisemitismus of unhappy memory.

2 The quotations are all drawn from Jacob Katz, Exclusiveness and Tolerance, Jewish-Gentile Relations in Medieval and Modern Times, New York, 1962 (Chapter 12), an entirely original study, written on the highest possible level, which indeed should have exploded “many cherished notions of contemporary Jewry,” as the jacket claims, but did not because it was almost completely ignored by the general press. Katz belongs among the younger generation of Jewish historians, many of whom teach at the Jerusalem University and publish in Hebrew. Why their work is not more speedily translated and published in this country is something of a mystery. With them, the “lachrymose” presentation of Jewish history, against which Salo W. Baron protested nearly forty years ago, has indeed come to an end.

7 The only exception is the antisemitic historian Walter Frank, the head of the Nazi Reichsinstitut für Geschichte des Neuen Deutschlands and the editor of nine volumes of Forschungen zur Judenfrage, 1937–1944. Especially Frank’s own contributions can still be consulted with profit.

4 According to Mr. Dulles, the government had to “fight fire with fire,” and then with a disarming frankness by which the former head of the CIA distinguished himself from his colleagues in other countries, he went on to explain what this meant. The CIA, by implication, had to model itself upon the Soviet State Security Service, which “is more than a secret police organization, more than an intelligence and counter-intelligence organization. It is an instrument for subversion, manipulation and violence, for secret intervention in the affairs of other countries.” (Italics added.) See Allen W. Dulles, The Craft of Intelligence, New York, 1963, p. 155.

1 No doubt, the fact that totalitarian government, its open criminality notwithstanding, rests on mass support is very disquieting. It is therefore hardly surprising that scholars as well as statesmen often refuse to recognize it, the former by believing in the magic of propaganda and brainwashing, the latter by simply denying it, as for instance Adenauer did repeatedly. A recent publication of secret reports on German public opinion during the war (from 1939 to 1944), issued by the Security Service of the SS (Meldungen aus dem Reich. Auswahl aus den Geheimen Lageberichten des Sicherheitsdienstes der SS 1939–1944, edited by Heinz Boberach, Neuwied & Berlin, 1965), is very revealing in this respect. It shows, first, that the population was remarkably well informed about all so-called secrets—massacres of Jews in Poland, preparation of the attack on Russia, etc.—and, second, the “extent to which the victims of propaganda had remained able to form independent opinions” (pp. XVIII-XIX). However, the point of the matter is that this did not in the least weaken the general support of the Hitler regime. It is quite obvious that mass support for totalitarianism comes neither from ignorance nor from brainwashing.

2 From the beginning, investigation and publication of documentary material have been guided by concern for criminal activities, and the selection has usually been made for the purpose of prosecution of war criminals. The result is that a great amount of highly interesting material has been neglected. The book mentioned in note 1 is a very welcome exception from the rule.

5 To an estimated nine to twelve million victims of the First Five Year Plan (1928–1933) must be added the victims of the Great Purge—an estimated three million executed while five to nine million were arrested and deported. (See Robert C. Tucker’s important introduction, “Stalin, Bukharin, and History as Conspiracy,” to the new edition of the verbatim report of the 1938 Moscow Trial, The Great Purge Trial, New York, 1965.) But all these estimates seem to fall short of the actual number. They do not take into account mass executions of which nothing was known until “German occupation forces discovered a mass grave in the city of Vinnitsa containing thousands of bodies of persons executed in 1937 and 1938.” (See John A. Armstrong, The Politics of Totalitarianism. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1934 to the Present, New York, 1961, pp. 65 f.) Needless to say, this recent discovery makes the Nazi and the Bolshevik systems look even more than before like variations of the same model.—To what extent the mass killings of the Stalin era are in the center of the present opposition can best be seen in the trial of Sinyavsky and Daniel, of which the New York Times Magazine published key sections on April 17, 1966, and from which I quoted.

7 Quoted from Merle Fainsod, How Russia Is Ruled, Cambridge, 1959, p. 516.—Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov (in The Reign of Stalin, published under the pseudonym Uralov in London, 1953) tells of a secret meeting of the Central Committee of the Party in 1936 after the first show trials, in which Bukharin reportedly accused Stalin of changing Lenin’s party into a police state and was supported by more than two-thirds of the members. The story, especially the allegedly strong support of Bukharin in the Central Committee, does not sound very plausible; but even if true, in view of the fact that this meeting occurred while the Great Purge was already in full swing, the story does not indicate an organized opposition but rather its opposite. The truth of the matter, as Fainsod rightly points out, seems to be that “wide-spread mass discontent” was quite common, especially among the peasants, and that up to 1928, “at the beginning of the First Five Year Plan strikes . . . were not uncommon,” but that such “oppositional moods never come to a focus in any form of organized challenge to the regime,” and that by 1929 or 1930 “every organizational alternative had faded from the scene” if it ever had existed before. (See Smolensk under Soviet Rule, pp. 449 ff.)

8 “The wonder,” as Fainsod, op. cit., p. 38, points out, “is not merely that the Party was victorious, but that it managed to survive at all.”

9 Ibid., pp. 49 ff.—A report from 1929 recounts violent antisemitic outbursts during a meeting; the Komsomol people “in the audience kept silent. . . . The impression was obtained that they were all in agreement with the anti-Jewish statements” (p. 445).

[back]



* * *



10 All reports from 1926 show a significant “decline in so-called counter-revolutionary outbreaks, a measure of the temporary truce which the regime had worked out with the peasantry.” Compared with 1926, the reports from 1929–1930 “read like communiqués from a flaming battle front” (p. 177).

15 This alternative is usually overlooked in the literature because of the understandable, but historically untenable, conviction of a more or less smooth development from Lenin to Stalin. It is true that Stalin almost always talked in Leninist terms, so that it sometimes looks as though the only difference between the two men lay in the brutality or “insanity” of Stalin’s character. Whether or not this was a conscious ruse on the side of Stalin, the truth of the matter is—as Tucker, op. cit., p. XVI, rightly observes—that “Stalin filled these old Leninist concepts with a new, distinctively Stalinist content . . . The chief distinctive feature was the quite un-Leninist emphasis upon conspiracy as the hallmark of the present epoch.”

17 Ibid., p. 93 and p. 71: It is quite characteristic that messages on all levels habitually stressed the “obligations undertaken to Comrade Stalin,” and not to the regime or the party or the country. Nothing perhaps underlines more convincingly the similarities of the two systems than what Ilya Ehrenburg and other Stalinist intellectuals have to say today in their efforts to justify their past or simply to report what they actually thought during the Great Purge. “Stalin knew nothing about the senseless violence committed against the Communists, against the Soviet intelligentsia,” “they conceal it from Stalin” and “if only someone would tell Stalin about it,” or, finally, the culprit was not Stalin at all but the respective chief of police. (Quoted from Tucker, op. cit., p. XIII.) Needless to add, this was precisely what the Nazis had to say after the defeat of Germany.

20 An interesting OGPU report from 1931 stresses this new “complete passivity,” this horrible apathy which the random terror against innocent people produced. The report mentions the great difference between the former arrests of enemies of the regime when “an arrested man was led by two militiamen” and the mass arrests when “one militiaman may lead groups of people and the latter calmly walk and no one flees” (p. 248).

But no such luck. The next speaker accused the man who had tried to outdo Stalin of being “politically disloyal,” whereupon the former promptly “confessed” his error.

23 Strangely enough, Fainsod himself still draws such conclusions from a mass of evidence that points into the opposite direction. See his last chapter, especially pp. 453 ff.—It is even stranger that this misreading of the factual evidence should be shared by so many authors in the field. To be sure, hardly any of them would go so far in this subtle justification of Stalin as Isaac Deutscher in his biography, but many still insist that “Stalin’s ruthless actions were . . . a way to the creation of a new equilibrium of forces” (Armstrong, op cit., p. 64) and designed to offer “a brutal but consistent solution of some of the basic contradictions inherent in the Leninist myth” (Richard Lowenthal in his very valuable World Communism. The Disintegration of a Secular Faith, New York, 1964, p. 42). There are but few exceptions from this Marxist hangover, such as Richard C. Tucker (op. cit., p. XXVII), who says unequivocally that the Soviet “system would have been better off and far more equipped to meet the coming test of total war had there been no Great Purge, which was, in effect, a great wrecking operation in Soviet society.” Mr. Tucker believes that this refutes my “image” of totalitarianism, which, I think, is a misunderstanding. Instability is indeed a functional requisite of total domination, which is based on an ideological fiction and presupposes that a movement, as distinguished from a party, has seized power. The hallmark of this system is that substantial power, the material strength and well-being of the country, is constantly sacrificed to the power of organization, just as all factual truths are sacrificed to the demands of ideological consistency. It is obvious that in a contest between material strength and organizational power, or between fact and fiction, the latter may come to grief, and this happened in Russia as well as Germany during the Second World War. But this is no reason to underestimate the power of totalitarian movements. It was the terror of permanent instability that helped to organize the satellite system, and it is the present stability of Soviet Russia, its detotalitarization, which, on one side, has greatly contributed to her present material strength, but which, on the other, has caused her to lose control of her satellites.

24 See the interesting details (Fainsod, op. cit., pp. 345–355) about the 1929 campaign to eliminate “reactionary professors” against the protests of party and Komsomol members as well as the student body, who saw “no reason to replace the excellent non-Party” professors; whereupon of course a new commission promptly reported “the large number of class-alien elements among the student body.” That it was one of the main purposes of the Great Purge to open the careers to the younger generation has always been known.

25 Armstrong, op. cit., p. 319, argues that the importance of Marshal Zhukov’s intervention in the inner-party struggle has been “highly exaggerated” and maintains that Khrushchev “triumphed without any need for military intervention,” because he was “supported by the Party apparatus.” This seems not to be true. But it is true that “many foreign observers,” because of the role of the army in support of Khrushchev against the party appai atus, arrived at the mistaken conclusion of a lasting power increase of the military at the expense of the party, as though the Soviet Union was about to change from a party dictatorship into a military dictatorship.

1 To the modern historian rights and liberties granted the court Jews during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries may appear to be only the forerunners of equality: court Jews could live wherever they liked, they were permitted to travel freely within the realm of their sovereign, they were allowed to bear arms and had rights to special protection from local authorities. Actually these court Jews, characteristically called Generalprivilegierte Juden in Prussia, not only enjoyed better living conditions than their fellow Jews who still lived under almost medieval restrictions, but they were better off than their non-Jewish neighbors. Their standard of living was much higher than that of the contemporary middle class, their privileges in most cases were greater than those granted to the merchants. Nor did this situation escape the attention of their contemporaries. Christian Wilhelm Dolim, the outstanding advocate of Jewish emancipation in eighteenth-century Prussia, complained of the practice, in force since the time of Frederick William I, which granted rich Jews “all sorts of favors and support” often “at the expense of, and with neglect of diligent legal [that is, non-Jewish] citizens.” In Denkwürdigkeiten meiner Zeit, Lemgo, 1814–1819, IV, 487.

2 Jacob Lestschinsky, in an early discussion of the Jewish problem, pointed out that Jews did not belong to any social class, and spoke of a “Klasseneinschiebsel” (in Weltwirtschafts-Archiv, 1929, Band 30, 123 ff.), but saw only the disadvantages of this situation in Eastern Europe, not its great advantages in Western and Central European countries.

3 For example, under Frederick II after the Seven Years’ War, a decided effort was made in Prussia to incorporate the Jews into a kind of mercantile system. The older general Juden-reglement of 1750 was supplanted by a system of regular permits issued only to those inhabitants who invested a considerable part of their fortune in new manufacturing enterprises. But here, as everywhere else, such government attempts failed completely.

4 Felix Priebatsch (“Die Judenpolitik des fürstlichen Absolutismus im 17. und 18. Jahrhundert,” in Forschungen und Versuche zur Geschichte des Mittelalters und der Neuzeit, 1915) cites a typical example from the early eighteenth century: “When the mirror factory in Neuhaus, Lower Austria, which was subsidized by the administration, did not produce, the Jew Wertheimer gave the Emperor money to buy it. When asked to take over the factory he refused, stating that his time was taken up with his financial transactions.”

See also Max Köhler, “Beiträge zur neueren jüdischen Wirtschaftsgeschichte. Die Juden in Halberstadt und Umgebung,” in Studien zur Geschichte der Wirtschaft und Ceisteskultur, 1927, Band 3.

In this tradition, which kept rich Jews from real positions of power in capitalism, is the fact that in 1911 the Paris Rothschilds sold their share in the oil wells of Baku to the Royal Shell group, after having been, with the exception of Rockefeller, the world’s biggest petroleum tycoons. This incident is reported in Richard Lewinsohn, Wie sie gross und reich wurden, Berlin, 1927.

André Sayou’s Statement (“Les Juifs” in Revue Economique Internationale, 1932) in his polemic against Werner Sombart’s identification of Jews with capitalist development, may be taken as a general rule: “The Rothschilds and other Israelites who were almost exclusively engaged in launching state loans and in the international movement of capital, did not try at ail . . . to create great industries.”

5 The influence, however, of mercantile experiments on future developments can hardly be overrated. France was the only country where the mercantile system was tried consistently and resulted in an early flourishing of manufactures which owed their existence to state interference; she never quite recovered from the experience. In the era of free enterprise, her bourgeoisie shunned unprotected investment in native industries while her bureaucracy, also a product of the mercantile system, survived its collapse. Despite the fact that the bureaucracy also lost all its productive functions, it is even today more characteristic of the country and a greater impediment to her recovery than the bourgeoisie.

6 This had been the case in England since Queen Elizabeth’s Marrano banker and the Jewish financiers of Cromwell’s armies, until one of the twelve Jewish brokers admitted to the London Stock Exchange was said to have handled one-quarter of all government loans of his day (see Salo W. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews, 1937, Vol. II: Jews and Capitalism); in Austria, where in only forty years (1695–1739), the Jews credited the government with more than 35 million florins and where the death of Samuel Oppenheimer in 1703 resulted in a grave financial crisis for both state and Emperor; in Bavaria, where in 1808 80 per cent of all government loans were endorsed and negotiated by Jews (see M. Grunwald, Samuel Oppenheimer und sein Kreis, 1913); in France, where mercantile conditions were especially favorable for the Jews, Colbert already praised their great usefulness to the state (Baron, op. cit., loc. cit.), and where in the middle of the eighteenth century the German Jew, Liefman Calmer, was made a baron by a grateful king who appreciated services and loyalty to “Our state and Our person” (Robert Anchel, “Un Baron Juif Français au 18e siècle, Liefman Calmer,” in Souvenir et Science, I, pp. 52–55); and also in Prussia where Frederick H’s Münjuden were titled and where, at the end of the eighteenth century, 400 Jewish families formed one of the wealthiest groups in Berlin. (One of the best descriptions of Berlin and the role of the Jews in its society at the turn of the eighteenth century is to be found in Wilhelm Dilthey, Das Leben Schleiermachers, 1870, pp. 182 ff.).

7 Early in the eighteenth century, Austrian Jews succeeded in banishing Eisemenger’s Entdecktes Judentum, 1703, and at the end of it, The Merchant of Venice could be played in Berlin only with a little prologue apologizing to the (not emancipated) Jewish audience.

8 The only, and irrelevant, exception might be those tax collectors, called fermiers-généraux, in France, who rented from the state the right to collect taxes by guaranteeing a fixed amount to the government. They earned their great wealth from and depended directly upon the absolute monarchy, but were too small a group and too isolated a phenomenon to be economically influential by themselves.

[back]



* * *



9 The urgencies compelling the ties between government business and the Jews may be gauged by those cases in which decidedly anti-Jewish officials had to carry out the policies. So Bismarck, in his youth, made a few antisemitic speeches only to become, as chancellor of the Reich, a close friend of Bleichroeder and a reliable protector of the Jews against Court Chaplain Stoecker’s antisemitic movement in Berlin. William II, although as Crown Prince and a member of the anti-Jewish Prussian nobility very sympathetic to all antisemitic movements in the eighties, changed his antisemitic convictions and deserted his antisemitic protégés overnight when he inherited the throne.

10 As early as the eighteenth century, wherever whole Jewish groups got wealthy enough to be useful to the state, they enjoyed collective privileges and were separated as a group from their less wealthy and useful brethren, even in the same country. Like the Schutzjuden in Prussia, the Bordeaux and Bayonne Jews in France enjoyed equality long before the French Revolution and were even invited to present their complaints and propositions along with the other General Estates in the Convocation des Etats Généraux of 1787.

11 Jean Capefigue (Histoire des grandes opérations financières, Tome III: Banque, Bourses, Emprunts, 1855) pretends that during the July Monarchy only the Jews, and especially the house of Rothschild, prevented a sound state credit based upon the Banque de France. He also claims that the events of 1848 made the activities of the Rothschilds superfluous. Raphael Strauss (“The Jews in the Economic Evolution of Central Europe” in Jewish Social Studies, 111, 1, 1941) also remarks that after 1830 “public credit already became less of a risk so that Christian banks began to handle this business in increasing measure.” Against these interpretations stands the fact that excellent relations prevailed between the Rothschilds and Napoleon III, although there can be no doubt as to the general trend of the time.

13 According to an anecdote, faithfully reported by all his biographers, Bismarck said immediately after the French defeat in 1871: “First of all, Bleichroeder has got to go to Paris, to get together with his fellow Jews and to talk it (the five billion francs for reparations) over with the bankers.” (See Otto Joehlinger, Bismarck und die Juden, Berlin, 1921.)

17 This bourgeois pattern, however, should not be forgotten. If it were only a matter of individual motives and behavior patterns, the methods of the house of Rothschild certainly did not differ much from those of their Gentile colleagues.

19 How well the Rothschilds knew the sources of their strength is shown in their early house law according to which daughters and their husbands were eliminated from the business of the house. The girls were allowed, and after 1871, even encouraged, to marry into the non-Jewish aristocracy; the male descendants had to marry Jewish girls exclusively, and if possible (in the first generation this was generally the case) members of the family.

32 That Jewish emancipation would have to be carried out against the desires of Jewish representatives was common knowledge in the eighteenth century. Mirabeau argued before the Assemblée Nationale in 1789: “Gentlemen, is it because the Jews don’t want to be citizens that you don’t proclaim them citizens? In a government like the one you now establish, all men must be men; you must expel all those who are not or who refuse to become men.” The attitude of German Jews in the early nineteenth century is reported by J. M. Jost, Neuere Geschichte der Israeliten. 1815–1845, Berlin, 1846, Band 10.

43 The international solidarity of the workers’ movements was, as far as it went, an inter-European matter. Their indifference to foreign policy was also a kind of self-protection against both active participation in or struggle against the contemporary imperialist policies of their respective countries. As far as economic interests were concerned, it was all too obvious that everybody in the French or British or Dutch nation would feel the full impact of the fall of their empires, and not just capitalists and bankers.

54 Marx’s essay on the Jewish question is sufficiently well known not to warrant quotation. Since Boerne’s utterances, because of their merely polemical and un-theoretical character, are being forgotten today, we quote from the 72nd letter from Paris (January, 1832): “Rothschild kissed the Pope’s hand. . . . At last the order has come which God had planned when he created the world. A poor Christian kisses the Pope’s feet, and a rich Jew kisses his hand. If Rothschild had gotten his Roman loan at 60 per cent, instead of 65, and could have sent the cardinal-chamberlain more than ten thousand ducats, they would have allowed him to embrace the Holy Father. . . . Would it not be the greatest luck for the world if all kings were deposed and the Rothschild family placed on the throne?” Briefe aus Paris. 1830–1833.

55 This attitude is well described in the preface by the municipal councilor Paul Brousse to Cesare Lombroso’s famous work on antisemitism (1899). The characteristic part of the argument is contained in the following: “The small shopkeeper needs credit, and we know how badly organized and how expensive credit is these days. Here too the small merchant places the responsibility on the Jewish banker. All the way down to the worker—i.e. only those workers who have no clear notion of scientific socialism—everybody thinks the revolution is being advanced if the general expropriation of capitalists is preceded by the expropriation of Jewish capitalists, who are the most typical and whose names are the most familiar to the masses.”

56 For the surprising continuity in French antisemitic arguments, compare, for instance, Charles Fourier’s picture of the Jew “Iscariote” who arrives in France with 100,000 pounds, establishes himself in a town with six competitors in his field, crushes all the competing houses, amasses a great fortune, and returns to Germany (in Théorie des quatre mouvements, 1808, Oeuvres Complètes, 88 ff.) with Giraudoux’s picture of 1939: “By an infiltration whose secret I have tried in vain to detect, hundreds of thousands of Ashkenasim, who escaped from the Polish and Rumanian Ghettos, have entered our country . . . eliminating our fellow citizens and, at the same time, ruining their professional customs and traditions . . . and defying all investigations of census, taxes and labor.” In Pleins Pouvoirs, 1939.

1 Although Jews stood out more than other groups in the homogeneous populations of European countries, it does not follow that they are more threatened by discrimination than other groups in America. In fact, up to now, not the Jews but the Negroes—by nature and history the most unequal among the peoples of America—have borne the burden of social and economic discrimination.

This could change, however, if a political movement ever grew out of this merely social discrimination. Then Jews might very suddenly become the principal objects of hatred for the simple reason that they, alone among all other groups, have themselves, within their history and their religion, expressed a well-known principle of separation. This is not true of the Negroes or Chinese, who are therefore less endangered politically, even though they may differ more from the majority than the Jews.

2 This surprisingly apt observation was made by the liberal Protestant theologian H. E. G.

12 This does not, however, apply to Moses Mendelssohn, who hardly knew the thoughts of Herder, Goethe, Schleiermacher, and other members of the younger generation. Mendelssohn was revered for his uniqueness. His firm adherence to his Jewish religion made it impossible for him to break ultimately with the Jewish people, which his successors did as a matter of course. He felt he was “a member of an oppressed people who must beg for the good will and protection of the governing nation” (see his “Letter to Lavater,” 1770, in Gesammelte Schriften, Vol. VII, Berlin, 1930); that is, he always knew that the extraordinary esteem for his person paralleled an extraordinary contempt for his people. Since he, unlike Jews of following generations, did not share this contempt, he did not consider himself an exception.

13 The Prussia which Lessing had described as “Europe’s most enslaved country” was to Mendelssohn “a state in which one of the wisest princes who ever ruled men has made the arts and sciences flourish, has made national freedom of thought so general that its beneficent effects reach even the lowliest inhabitants of his domain.” Such humble contentment is touching and surprising if one realizes that the “wisest prince” had made it very hard for the Jewish philosopher to get permission to sojourn in Berlin and, at a time when his Munzjuden enjoyed all privileges, did not even grant him the regular status of a “protected Jew.” Mendelssohn was even aware that he, the friend of all educated Germany, would be subject to the same tax levied upon an ox led to the market if ever he decided to visit his friend Lavater in Leipzig, but no political conclusion regarding the improvement of such conditions ever occurred to him. (See the “Letter to Lavater,” op. cit., and his preface to his translation of Menasseh Ben Israel in Gesammelte Schriften, Vol. III, Leipzig, 1843–45.)

18 Op. cit., IX, 38.—The court Jews and the rich Jewish bankers who followed in their footsteps never wanted to leave the Jewish community. They acted as its representatives and protectors against public authorities; they were frequently granted official power over communities which they ruled from afar so that the old autonomy of Jewish communities was undermined and destroyed from within long before it was abolished by the nation-state. The first court Jew with monarchical aspirations in his own “nation” was a Jew of Prague, a purveyor of supplies to the Elector Maurice of Saxony in the sixteenth century. He demanded that all rabbis and community heads be selected from members of his family. (See Bondy-Dworsky, Geschichte der Juden in Boehmen, Maehren und Schlesien, Prague, 1906, II, 727.) The practice of installing court Jews as dictators in their communities became general in the eighteenth century and was followed by the rule of “notables” in the nineteenth century.

23 A remarkable, though little-known, fact is that assimilation as a program led much more frequently to conversion than to mixed marriage. Unfortunately statistics cover up rather than reveal this fact because they consider all unions between converted and nonconverted Jewish partners to be mixed marriages. We know, however, that there were quite a number of families in Germany who had been baptized for generations and yet remained purely Jewish. That the converted Jew only rarely left his family and even more rarely left his Jewish surroundings altogether, accounts for this. The Jewish family, at any rate, proved to be a more conserving force than Jewish religion.

After having quoted Tennyson’s In Memoriam, canto 64, it continues as follows: “In one respect Disraeli’s success was more striking and complete than that suggested in Tennyson’s lines; he not only scaled the political ladder to the topmost rung and ‘shaped the whisper of the throne’; he also conquered Society. He dominated the dinner-tables and what we would call the salons of Mayfair . . . and his social triumph, whatever may be thought by philosophers of its intrinsic value, was certainly not less difficult of achievement for a despised outsider than his political, and was perhaps sweeter to his palate” (p. 1506).

61 The fact that certain psychological phenomena did not come out as sharply in German and Austrian Jews, may partly be due to the strong hold of the Zionist movement on Jewish intellectuals in these countries. Zionism in the decade after the first World War, and even in the decade preceding it, owed its strength not so much to political insight (and did not produce political convictions), as it did to its critical analysis of psychological reactions and sociological facts. Its influence was mainly pedagogical and went far beyond the relatively small circle of actual members of the Zionist movement.

10 Weygand, a known adherent of the Action Française, was in his youth an Anti-Dreyfusard. He was one of the subscribers to the “Henry Memorial” established by the Libre Parole in honor of the unfortunate Colonel Henry, who paid with suicide for his forgeries while on the General Staff. The list of subscribers was later published by Quillard, one of the editors of L’Aurore (Clemenceau’s paper), under the title of Le Monument Henry, Paris, 1899. As for Pétain, he was on the general staff of the military government of Paris from 1895 to 1899, at a time when nobody but a proven anti-Dreyfusard would have been tolerated. See Contamine de Latour, “Le Maréchal Pétain,” in Revue de Paris, I, 57–69. D. W. Brogan, op. cit., p. 382, pertinently observes that of the five World War I marshals, four (Foch, Pétain, Lyautey, and Fayolle) were bad republicans, while the fifth, Joffre, had well-known clerical leanings.

15 A distinctly modern note is struck in Zola’s Letter to France of 1898: “We hear on all sides that the concept of liberty has gone bankrupt. When the Dreyfus business cropped up, this prevalent hatred of liberty found a golden opportunity. . . . Don’t you see that the only reason why Scheurer-Kestner has been attacked with such fury is that he belongs to a generation which believed in liberty and worked for it? Today one shrugs one’s shoulders at such things . . . ‘Old greybeards,’ one laughs, ‘outmoded greathearts.’” Herzog, op. cit., under date of January 6, 1898.

28 Jacques Reinach was born in Germany, received an Italian barony and was naturalized in France. Cornélius Herz was born in France, the son of Bavarian parents. Migrating to America in early youth, he acquired citizenship and amassed a fortune there. For further details, cf. Brogan, op. cit., p. 268 ff.

Characteristic of the way in which native Jews disappeared from public office is the fact that as soon as the affairs of the Panama Company began to go badly, Lévy-Crémieux, its original financial adviser, was replaced by Reinach; see Brogan, op. cit., Book VI, chapter 2.

44 The Jesuits’ magazine Civiltà Cattolica was for decades the most outspokenly antisemitic and one of the most influential Catholic magazines in the world.

See Joshua Starr, “Italy’s Antisemites,” in Jewish Social Studies, 1939.

Their desire to assimilate completely to Gallic modes, to live on intimate terms with our old-established families, to occupy the most distinguished positions in the state, and the contempt which they showed for the commercial elements of Jewry, for the recently naturalized ‘Polaks’ of Galicia, gave them almost the appearance of traitors against their own race. . . .

See also Herzog, op. cit., under date of 1892 and June, 1894, where these duels are listed in detail and all of Esterhazy’s intermediaries named. The last occasion was in September, 1896, when he received 10,000 francs. This misplaced generosity was later to have disquieting results. When, from the comfortable security of England, Esterhazy at length made his revelations and thereby compelled a revision of the case, the antisemitic press naturally suggested that he had been paid by the Jews for his self-condemnation. The idea is still advanced as a major argument in favor of Dreyfus’ guilt.

53 Herzog, op. cit., under date of 1892 shows at length how the Rothschilds began to adapt themselves to the republic. Curiously enough the papal policy of coalitionism, which represents an attempt at rapprochement by the Catholic Church, dates from precisely the same year. It is therefore not impossible that the Rothschild line was influenced by the clergy. As for the loan of 500 million francs to Russia, Count Munster pertinently observed: “Speculation is dead in France. . . . The capitalists can find no way of negotiating their securities . . . and this will contribute to the success of the loan. . . . The big Jews believe that if they make money they will best be able to help their small-time brethren. The result is that, though the French market is glutted with Russian securities, Frenchmen are still giving good francs for bad roubles”; Herzog, ibid.

57 The Dreyfus family, for instance, summarily rejected the suggestion of Arthur Lévy, the writer, and Lévy-Bruhl, the scholar, that they should circulate a petition of protest among all leading figures of public life. Instead they embarked on a series of personal approaches to any politician with whom they happened to have contact; cf. Dutrait-Crozon, op. cit., p. 51.

59 Labori’s withdrawal, after Dreyfus’ family had hurriedly withdrawn the brief from him while the Rennes tribunal was still sitting, caused a major scandal. An exhaustive, if greatly exaggerated, account will be found in Frank, op. cit., p. 432. Labori’s own statement, which speaks eloquently for his nobility of character, appeared in La Grande Revue (February, 1900). After what had happened to his counsel and friend Zola at once broke relations with the Dreyfus family. As for Picquart, the Echo de Paris (November 30, 1901) reported that after Rennes he had nothing more to do with the Dreyfuses. Clemenceau in face of the fact that the whole of France, or even the whole world, grasped the real meaning of the trials better than the accused or his family, was more inclined to consider the incident humorous; cf. Weil, op. cit., pp. 307–8.

61 Very characteristic in this respect are the various depictions of contemporary society in J. Reinach, op. cit., I, 233 ff.; III, 141: “Society hostesses fell in step with Guérin. Their language (which scarcely outran their thoughts) would have struck horror in the Amazon of Damohey . . .” Of special interest in this connection is an article by André Chevrillon, “Huit Jours á Rennes,” in La Grande Revue, February, 1900. He relates, inter alia, the following revealing incident: “A physician speaking to some friends of mine about Dreyfus, chanced to remark, ‘I’d like to torture him.’ ‘And I wish,’ rejoined one of the ladies, ‘that he were innocent. Then he’d suffer more.’”

64 A study of European superstition would probably show that Jews became objects of this typically nineteenth-century brand of superstition fairly late.

70 Immediately after he had made his discoveries Picquart was banished to a dangerous post in Tunis. Thereupon he made his will, exposed the whole business, and deposited, a copy of the document with his lawyer. A few months later, when it was discovered that he was still alive, a deluge of mysterious letters came pouring in, compromising him and accusing him of complicity with the “traitor” Dreyfus. He was treated like a gangster who had threatened to “squeal.” When all this proved of no avail, he was arrested, drummed out of the army, and divested of his decorations, all of which he endured with quiet equanimity.

99 Lazare’s position in the Dreyfus Affair is best described by Charles Péguy, “Notre Jeunesse,” in Cahiers de la quinzaine, Paris, 1910. Regarding him as the true representative of Jewish interests, Péguy formulates Lazare’s demands as follows: “He was a partisan of the impartiality of the law. Impartiality of law in the Dreyfus case, impartial law in the case of the religious orders. This seems like a trifle; this can lead far. This led him to isolation in death.” (Translation quoted from Introduction to Lazare’s Job’s Dungheap.) Lazare was one of the first Dreyfusards to protest against the law governing congregations.

7 This bad conscience springing from the belief in consent as the basis of all political organization is very well described by Harold Nicolson, Curzon: The Last Phase 1919–1925, Boston-New York, 1934, in the discussion of British policy in Egypt: “The justification of our presence in Egypt remains based, not upon the defensible right of conquest, or on force, butt upon our own belief in the element of consent. That element, in 1919, did not in any articulate form exist. It was dramatically challenged by the Egyptian outburst of March 1919.”

9 Why in the initial stages of national development the Tudors did not succeed in incorporating Ireland into Great Britain as the Valois had succeeded in incorporating Brittany and Burgundy into France, is still a riddle. It may be, however, that a similar process was brutally interrupted by the Cromwell regime, which treated Ireland as one great piece of booty to be divided among its servants. After the Cromwell revolution, at any rate, which was as crucial for the formation of the British nation as the French Revolution became for the French, the United Kingdom had already reached that stage of maturity that is always accompanied by a loss of the power of assimilation and integration which the body politic of the nation possesses only in its initial stages. What then followed was, indeed, one long sad story of “coercion [that] was not imposed that the people might live quietly but that people might die quietly” (Chesterton, op. cit., p. 60).

For a historical survey of the Irish question that includes the latest developments, compare the excellent unbiased study of Nicholas Mansergh, Britain and Ireland (in Longman’s Pamphlets on the British Commonwealth, London, 1942).

10 Very characteristic is the following statement of J. A. Froude made shortly before the beginning of the imperialist era: “Let it be once established that an Englishman emigrating to Canada or the Cape, or Australia, or New Zealand did not forfeit his nationality, that he was still on English soil as much as if he was in Devonshire or Yorkshire, and would remain an Englishman while the English Empire lasted; and if we spent a quarter of the sums which were sunk in the morasses at Balaclava in sending out and establishing two millions of our people in those colonies, it would contribute more to the essential strength of the country than all the wars in which we have been entangled from Agincourt to Waterloo.” Quoted from Robert Livingston Schuyler, The Fall of the Old Colonial System, New York, 1945, pp. 280–81.

11 The eminent South African writer, Jan Disselboom, expressed very bluntly the attitude of the Commonwealth peoples on this question: “Great Britain is merely a partner in the concern . . . all descended from the same closely allied stock. . . . Those parts of the Empire which are not inhabited by races of which this is true, were never partners in the concern. They were the private property of the predominant partner. . . . You can have the white dominion, or you can have the Dominion of India, but you cannot have both.” (Quoted from A. Carthill, The Lost Dominion, 1924.)

16 A similar attempt at brutal exploitation of overseas possessions for the sake of the nation was made by the Netherlands in the Dutch East Indies after the defeat of Napoleon had restored the Dutch colonies to the much impoverished mother country. By means of compulsory cultivation the natives were reduced to slavery for the benefit of the government in Holland. Multatuli’s Max Havelaar, first published in the sixties of the last century, was aimed at the government at home and not at the services abroad. (See de Kat Angelino, Colonial Policy, Vol. II, The Dutch East Indies, Chicago, 1931, p. 45.)

This system was quickly abandoned and the Netherlands Indies, for a while, became “the admiration of all colonizing nations.” (Sir Hesketh Bell, former Governor of Uganda, Northern Nigeria, etc., Foreign Colonial Administration in the Far East, 1928, Part I). The Dutch methods have many similarities with the French: the granting of European status to deserving natives, introduction of a European school system, and other devices of gradual assimilation. The Dutch thereby achieved the same result: a strong national independence movement among the subject people.

In the present study Dutch and Belgian imperialism are being neglected. The first is a curious and changing mixture of French and English methods; the second is the story not of the expansion of the Belgian nation or even the Belgian bourgeoisie, but of the expansion of the Belgian king personally, unchecked by any government, unconnected with any other institution. Both the Dutch and the Belgian forms of imperialism are atypical. The Netherlands did not expand during the eighties, but only consolidated and modernized their old possessions. The unequalled atrocities committed in the Belgian Congo, on the other hand, would offer too unfair an example for what was generally happening in overseas possessions.

23 The first scholar to use the term imperialism to differentiate clearly between the “Empire” and the “Commonwealth” was J. A. Hobson. But the essential difference was always well known. The principle of “colonial freedom” for instance, cherished by all liberal British statesmen after the American Revolution, was held valid only insofar as the colony was “formed of the British people or . . . such admixture of the British population as to make it safe to introduce representative institutions.” See Robert Livingston Schuyler, op. cit., pp. 236 ff.

In the nineteenth century, we must distinguish three types of overseas possessions Within the British Empire: the settlements or plantations or colonies, like Australia and other dominions; the trade stations and possessions like India; and the maritime and military stations like the Cape of Good Hope, which were held for the sake of the former. All these possessions underwent a change in government and political significance in the era of imperialism.

26 The origin of this misnomer probably lies in the history of British rule in South Africa, and goes back to the times when the local governors, Cecil Rhodes and Jameson, involved the “Imperial Government” in London, much against its intentions, in the war against the Boers. “In fact Rhodes, or rather Jameson, was absolute ruler of a territory three times the size of England, which could be administered ‘without waiting for the grudging assent or polite censure of the High Commissioner’” who was the representative of an Imperial Government that retained only “nominal control.” (Reginal Ivan Lovell, The Struggle for South Africa, 1875–1899, New York, 1934, p. 194.) And what happens in territories in which the British government has resigned its jurisdiction to the local European population that lacks all traditional and constitutional restraint of nation-states, can best be seen in the tragic story of the South African Union since its independence, that is, since the time when the “Imperial Government” no longer had any right to interfere.

27 The discussion in the House of Commons in May, 1908, between Charles Dilke and the Colonial Secretary is interesting in this respect. Dilke warned against giving self-government to the Crown colonies because this would result in rule of the white planters over their colored workers. He was told that the natives too had a representation in the English House of Commons. See G. Zoepfl, “Kolonien und Kolonialpolitik” in Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften.

30 An instance of “pacification” in the Near East was described at great length by T. E. Lawrence in an article “France, Britain and the Arabs” written for The Observer (1920): “There is a preliminary Arab success, the British reinforcements go out as a punitive force. They fight their way . . . to their objective, which is meanwhile bombarded by artillery, aeroplanes, or gunboats. Finally perhaps a village is burnt and the district pacified. It is odd that we don’t use poison gas on these occasions. Bombing the houses is a patchy way of getting the women and children. . . . By gas attacks the whole population of offending districts could be wiped out neatly; and as a method of government it would be no more immoral than the present system.” See his Letters, edited by David Garnett, New York, 1939, pp. 311 ff.

34 It is interesting that all early observers of imperialist developments stress this Jewish element very strongly while it hardly plays any role in more recent literature. Especially noteworthy, because very reliable in observation and very honest in analysis, is J. A. Hobson’s development in this respect. In the first essay which he wrote on the subject, “Capitalism and Imperialism in South Africa” (in Contemporary Review, 1900), he said: “Most of (the financiers) were Jews, for the Jews are par excellence the international financiers, and, though English-speaking, most of them are of continental origin. . . . They went there (Transvaal) for money, and those who came early and made most have commonly withdrawn their persons, leaving their economic fangs in the carcass of their prey. They fastened on the Rand . . . as they are prepared to fasten upon any other spot upon the globe. . . . Primarily, they are financial speculators taking their gains not out of the genuine fruits of industry, even the industry of others, but out of construction, promotion and financial manipulation of companies.” In Hobson’s later study Imperialism, however, the Jews are not even mentioned; it had become obvious in the meantime that their influence and role had been temporary and somewhat superficial.

For the role of Jewish financiers in South Africa, see chapter vii.

36 The coincidence of this identification with the totalitarian pretense of having abolished the contradictions between individual and public interests is significant enough (see chapter xii). However, one should not overlook the fact that Hobbes wanted most of all to protect private interests by pretending that, rightly understood, they were the interests of the body politic as well, while on the contrary totalitarian regimes proclaim the nonexistence of privacy.

37 The elevation of chance to the position of final arbiter over the whole of life was to reach its full development in the nineteenth century. With it came a new genre of literature, the novel, and the decline of the drama. For the drama became meaningless in a world without action, while the novel could deal adequately with the destinies of human beings who were either the victims of necessity or the favorites of luck. Balzac showed the full range of the new genre and even presented human passions as man’s fate, containing neither virtue nor vice, neither reason nor free will. Only the novel in its full maturity, having interpreted and re-interpreted the entire scale of human matters, could preach the new gospel of infatuation with one’s own fate that has played such a great role among nineteenth-century intellectuals. By means of such infatuation the artist and intellectual tried to draw a line between themselves and the philistines, to protect themselves against the inhumanity of good or bad luck, and they developed all the gifts of modern sensitivity—for suffering, for understanding, for playing a prescribed role—which are so desperately needed by human dignity, which demands of a man that he at least be a willing victim if nothing else.

38 The presently popular liberal notion of a World Government is based, like all liberal notions of political power, on the same concept of individuals submitting to a central authority which “overawes them all,” except that nations are now taking the place of individuals. The World Government is to overcome and eliminate authentic politics, that is, different peoples getting along with each other in the full force of their power.

40 “The Services offer the cleanest and most natural support to an aggressive foreign policy; expansion of the empire appeals powerfully to the aristocracy and the professional classes by offering new and ever-growing fields for the honorable and profitable employment of their sons” (J. A. Hobson, “Capitalism and Imperialism in South Africa,” op. cit.). It was “above all . . . patriotic professors and publicists regardless of political affiliation and unmindful of personal economic interest” who sponsored “the outward imperialistic thrusts of the ’70ies and early ’80ies” (Hayes, op. cit., p. 220).

41 For this and the following see J. A. Hobson, Imperialism, who as early as 1905 gave a masterly analysis of the driving economic forces and motives as well as of some of its political implications.

42 The obvious connection between the severe crises in the sixties in England and the seventies on the Continent and imperialism is mentioned in Hayes, op. cit., in a footnote only (on p. 219), and in Schuyler, op. cit., who believes that “a revival of interest in emigration was an important factor in the beginnings of the imperial movement” and that this interest had been caused by “a serious depression in British trade and industry” toward the close of the sixties (p. 280). Schuyler also describes at some length the strong “anti-imperial sentiment of the mid-Victorian era.” Unfortunately, Schuyler makes no differentiation between the Commonwealth and the Empire proper, although the discussion of pre-imperialist material might easily have suggested such a differentiation.

45 According to Rosa Luxemburg’s brilliant insight into the political structure of imperialism (op. cit., pp. 273 ff., pp. 361 ff.), the “historical process of the accumulation of capital depends in all its aspects upon the existence of noncapitalist social strata,” so that “imperialism is the political expression of the accumulation of capital in its competition for the possession of the remainders of the noncapitalistic world.” This essential dependence of capitalism upon a noncapitalistic world lies at the basis of all other aspects of imperialism, which then may be explained as the results of oversaving and maldistribution (Hobson, op. cit.), as the result of overproduction and the consequent need for new markets (Lenin, Imperialism, the Last Stage of Capitalism, 1917), as the result of an undersupply of raw material (Hayes, op. cit.), or as capital export in order to equalize the national profit rate (Hilferding, op. cit.).

49 See Hilferding, op. cit., p. 406. “Hence the cry for strong state power by all capitalists with vested interests in foreign countries. . . . Exported capital feels safest when the state power of its own country rules the new domain completely. . . . Its profits should be guaranteed by the state if possible. Thus, exportation of capital favors an imperialist policy.” P. 423: “It is a matter of course that the attitude of the bourgeoisie toward the state undergoes a complete change when the political power of the state becomes a competitive instrument for the finance capital in the world market. The bourgeoisie had been hostile to the state in its fight against economic mercantilism and political absolutism. . . . Theoretically at least, economic life was to be completely free of state intervention; the state was to confine itself politically to the safeguarding of security and the establishment of civil equality.” P. 426: “However, the desire for an expansionist policy causes a revolutionary change in the mentality of the bourgeoisie. It ceases to be pacifist and humanist.” P. 470: “Socially, expansion is a vital condition for the preservation of capitalist society; economically, it is the condition for the preservation of, and temporary increase in, the profit rate.”

50 These motives were especially outspoken in German imperialism. Among the first activities of the Alldeutsche Verband (founded in 1891) were efforts to prevent German emigrants from changing their citizenship, and the first imperialist speech of William II, on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the foundation of the Reich, contained the following typical passage: “The German Empire has become a World Empire. Thousands of our compatriots live everywhere, in distant parts of the earth. . . . Gentlemen, it is your solemn duty to help me unite this greater German Empire with our native country.” Compare also J. A. Froude’s statement in note 10.

5 “Huxley neglected scientific research of his own from the ’70’s onward, so busy was he in the role of ‘Darwin’s bulldog’ barking and biting at theologians” (Hayes, op. cit., p. 126). Ernst Haeckel’s passion for popularizing scientific results which was at least as strong as his passion for science itself, has been stressed recently by an applauding Nazi writer, H. Bruecher, “Ernst Haeckel, Ein Wegbereiter biologischen Staatsdenkens.” In Nationalsozialistische Monatshefte, 1935, Heft 69.

Two rather extreme examples may be quoted to show what scientists are capable of. Both were scholars of good standing, writing during World War I. The German historian of art, Josef Strzygowski, in his Altai, Iran und Völkerwanderung (Leipzig, 1917) discovered the Nordic race to be composed of Germans, Ukrainians, Armenians, Persians, Hungarians, Bulgars and Turks (pp. 306–307). The Society of Medicine of Paris not only published a report on the discovery of “polychesia” (excessive defecation) and “bromidrosis” (body odor) in the German race, but proposed urinalysis for the detection of German spies; German urine was “found” to contain 20 per cent non-uric nitrogen as against 15 per cent for other races. See Jacques Barzun, Race, New York. 1937, p. 239.

6 This quid pro quo was partly the result of the zeal of students who wanted to put down every single instance in which race has been mentioned. Thereby they mistook relatively harmless authors, for whom explanation by race was a possible and sometimes fascinating opinion, for full-fledged racists. Such opinions, in themselves harmless, were advanced by the early anthropologists as starting points of their investigations. A typical instance is the naïve hypothesis of Paul Broca, noted French anthropologist of the middle of the last century, who assumed that “the brain has something to do with race and the measured shape of the skull is the best way to get at the contents of the brain” (quoted after Jacques Barzun, op. cit., p. 162). It is obvious that this assertion, without the support of a conception of the nature of man, is simply ridiculous.

As for the philologists of the early nineteenth century, whose concept of “Aryanism” has seduced almost every student of racism to count them among the propagandists or even inventors of race-thinking, they are as innocent as innocent can be. When they overstepped the limits of pure research it was because they wanted to include in the same cultural brotherhood as many nations as possible. In the words of Ernest Seillière, La Philosophie de l’Impérialisme, 4 vols., 1903–1906: “There was a kind of intoxication: modern civilization believed it had recovered its pedigree . . . and an organism was born which embraced in one and the same fraternity all nations whose language showed some affinity with Sanskrit.” (Preface, Tome I, p. xxxv.) In other words, these men were still in the humanistic tradition of the eighteenth century and shared its enthusiasm about strange people and exotic cultures.

7 François Hotman, French sixteenth-century author of Frunco-Callia, is sometimes held to be a forerunner of eighteenth-century racial doctrines, as by Ernest Seillière, op. cit. Against this misconception, Théophile Simar has rightly protested: “Hotman appears, not as an apologist for the Teutons, but as the defender of the people which was oppressed by the monarchy” (Etude Critique sur la Formation de la doctrine des Races au 18e et son expansion au 19e siècle, Bruxelles, 1922, p. 20).

44 A significant if moderate echo of this inner bewilderment can be found in many an eighteenth-century traveling report. Voltaire thought it important enough to make a special note in his Dictionnaire Philosophique: “We have seen, moreover, how different the races are who inhabit this globe, and how great must have been the surprise of the first Negro and the first white man who met” (Article: Homme).

52 Almost a century before evolutionism had donned the cloak of science, warning voices foretold the inherent consequences of a madness that was then merely in the stage of pure imagination. Voltaire, more than once, had played with evolutionary opinions—see chiefly “Philosophie Générale: Métaphysique, Morale et Théologie,” Oeuvres Complètes, 1785, Tome 40, pp. 16ff.—In his Dictionnaire Philosophique, Article “Chaîne des Etres Créés,” he wrote: “At first, our imagination is pleased at the imperceptible transition of crude matter to organized matter, of plants to zoophytes, of these zoophytes to animals, of these to man, of man to spirits, of these spirits clothed with a small aerial body to immaterial substances; and . . . to God Himself. . . . But the most perfect spirit created by the Supreme Being, can he become God? Is there not an infinity between God and him? . . . Is there not obviously a void between the monkey and man?”

53 Hayes, op. cit., p. 11. Hayes rightly stresses the strong practical morality of all these early materialists. He explains “this curious divorce of morals from beliefs” by “what later sociologists have described as a time lag” (p. 130). This explanation, however, appears rather weak if one recalls that other materialists who, like Haeckel in Germany or Vacher de Lapouge in France, had left the calm of studies and research for propaganda activities, did not greatly suffer from such a time lag; that, on the other hand, their contemporaries who were not tinged by their materialistic doctrines, such as Barrés and Co. in France, were very practical adherents of the perverse brutality which swept France during the Dreyfus Affair. The sudden decay of morals in the Western world seems to be caused less by an autonomous development of certain “ideas” than by a series of new political events and new political and social problems which confronted a bewildered and confused humanity.

55 “A Biological View of Our Foreign Policy” was published by P. Charles Michel in Saturday Review, London, February, 1896. The most important works of this kind are: Thomas Huxley, The Struggle for Existence in Human Society, 1888. His main thesis: The fall of civilizations is necessary only as long as birthrate is uncontrolled. Benjamin Kidd, Social Evolution, 1894. John B. Crozier, History of Intellectual Development on the Lines of Modern Evolution, 1897–1901. Karl Pearson (National Life, 1901), Professor of Eugenics at London University, was among the first to describe progress as a kind of impersonal monster which devours everything that happens to be in its way. Charles H. Harvey, The Biology of British Politics, 1904, argues that by strict control of the “struggle for life” within the nation, a nation could become all-powerful for the inevitable fight with other people for existence.

4 It is important to bear in mind that colonization of America and Australia was accompanied by comparatively short periods of cruel liquidation because of the natives’ numerical weakness, whereas “in understanding the genesis of modern South African society it is of the greatest importance to know that the land beyond the Cape’s borders was not the open land which lay before the Australian squatter. It was already an area of settlement, of settlement by a great Bantu population.” See C. W. de Kiewiet, A History of South Africa, Social and Economic (Oxford, 1941), p. 59.

12 “Slaves and Hottentots together provoked remarkable changes in the thought and habits of the colonists, for climate and geography were not alone in forming the distinctive traits of the Boer race. Slaves and droughts, Hottentots and isolation, cheap labor and land, combined to create the institutions and habits of South African society. The sons and daughters born to sturdy Hollanders and Huguenots learned to look upon the labour of the field and upon all hard physical toil as the functions of a servile race” (Kiewiet, op. cit., p. 21).

17 “Little effort was made to raise the standard of living or increase the opportunities of the class of slaves and servants. In this manner, the limited wealth of the Colony became the privilege of its white population. . . . Thus early did South Africa learn that a self-conscious group may escape the worst effects of life in a poor and unprosperous land by turning distinctions of race and colour into devices for social and economic discrimination” (ibid., p. 22).

[back]



* * *



18 The point is that, for instance, in “the West Indies such a large proportion of slaves as were held at the Cape would have been a sign of wealth and a source of prosperity”; whereas “at the Cape slavery was the sign of an unenterprising economy . . . whose labour was wastefully and inefficiently used” (ibid.). It was chiefly this that led Barnes (op. cit., p. 107) and many other observers to the conclusion: “South Africa is thus a foreign country, not only in the sense that its standpoint is definitely un-British, but also in the much more radical sense that its very raison d’être, as an attempt at an organised society, is in contradiction to the principles on which the states of Christendom are founded.”

19 This corresponded to as many as 160,000 individuals (Kiewiet, op. cit., p. 181). James (op. cit., p. 43) estimated the number of poor whites in 1943 at 500,000 which would correspond to about 20 per cent of the white population.

20 “The poor while Afrikaaner population, living on the same subsistence level as the Bantus, is primarily the result of the Boers’ inability or stubborn refusal to learn agricultural science. Like the Bantu, the Boer likes to wander from one area to another, tilling the soil until it is no longer fertile, shooting the wild game until it ceases to exist” (ibid.).

21 “Their race was their title of superiority over the natives, and to do manual labour conflicted with the dignity conferred upon them by their race. . . . Such an aversion degenerated, in those who were most demoralized, into a claim to charity as a right” (Kiewiet, op. cit., p. 216).

22 The Dutch Reformed Church has been in the forefront of the Boers’ struggle against the influence of Christian missionaries on the Cape. In 1944, however, they went one step farther and adopted “without a single voice of dissent” a motion opposing the marriage of Boers with English-speaking citizens. (According to the Cape Times, editorial of July 18, 1944. Quoted from New Africa, Council on African Affairs. Monthly Bulletin, October, 1944.)

The Dutchmen were so electrified at the remark that they nearly fell off their chairs” (Barnes, op. cit., p. 33).

28 “The true Vortrekker hated a boundary. When the British Government insisted on fixed boundaries for the Colony and for farms within it, something was taken from him. . . . It was best surely to betake themselves across the border where there were water and free land and no British Government to disallow Vagrancy Laws and where white men could not be haled to court to answer the complaints of their servants” (Ibid., pp. 54–55). “The Great Trek, a movement unique in the history of colonization” (p. 58) “was the defeat of the policy of more intensive settlement. The practice which required the area of an entire Canadian township for the settlement of ten families was extended through all of South Africa. It made for ever impossible the segregation of white and black races in separate areas of settlement. . . . By taking the Boers beyond the reach of British law, the Great Trek enabled them to establish ‘proper’ relations with the native population” (p. 56). “In later years, the Great Trek was to become more than a protest; it was to become a rebellion against the British administration, and the foundation stone of the Anglo-Boer racialism of the twentieth century” (lames, op. cit., p. 28).

29 In 1939, the total population of the Union of South Africa amounted to 9,500,000 of whom 7,000,000 were natives and 2,500,000 Europeans. Of the latter, more than 1,250,000 were Boers, about one-third were British, and 100,000 were Jews. See Norman Bentwich, op. cit.

38 Kiewiet (op. cit., pp. 138–39) mentions, however, also another “set of circumstances”: “Any attempt by the British Government to secure concessions or reforms from the Transvaal Government made it inevitably the agent of the mining magnates. . . . Great Britain gave its support, whether this was clearly realized in Downing Street or not, to capital and mining investments.”

[back]

39 “Much of the hesitant and evasive conduct of British statesmanship in the generation before the Boer War could be attributed to the indecision of the British Government between its obligation to the natives and its obligation to the white communities. . . . Now, however, the Boer War compelled a decision on native policy. In the terms of the peace the British Government promised that no attempt would be made to alter the political status of the natives before self-government had been granted to the ex-Republics. In that epochal decision the British Government receded from its humanitarian position and enabled the Boer leaders to win a signal victory in the peace negotiations which marked their military defeat. Great Britain abandoned the effort to exercise a control over the vital relations between white and black. Downing Street had surrendered to the frontiers” (Kiewiet, op. cit., pp. 143–44).

40 “There is . . . an entirely erroneous notion that the Africaaners and the English-speaking people of South Africa still disagree on how to treat the natives. On the contrary, it is one of the few things on which they do agree” (lames, op. cit., p. 47).

41 This was mostly due to the methods of Alfred Beit who had arrived in 1875 to buy diamonds for a Hamburg firm. “Till then only speculators had been shareholders in mining ventures. . . . Beit’s method attracted the genuine investor also” (Emden, op. cit.).

42 Very characteristic in this respect was Barnato’s attitude when it came to the amalgamation of his business with the Rhodes group. “For Barnato the amalgamation was nothing but a financial transaction in which he wanted to make money. . . . He therefore desired that the company should have nothing to do with politics. Rhodes however was not merely a business man. . . .” This shows how very wrong Barnato was when he thought that “if I had received the education of Cecil Rhodes there would not have been a Cecil Rhodes” (ibid.).

44 The increase in profits from foreign investment and a relative decrease of foreign trade profits characterizes the economic side of imperialism. In 1899, it was estimated that Great Britain’s whole foreign and colonial trade had brought her an income of only 18 million pounds, while in the same year profits from foreign investment amounted to 90 or 100 million pounds. See J. A. Hobson, Imperialism, London, 1938, pp. 53 ff. It is obvious that investment demanded a much more conscious long-range policy of exploitation than mere trade.

45 Early Jewish settlers in South Africa in the eighteenth and the first part of the nineteenth century were adventurers; traders and merchants followed them after the middle of the century, among whom the most prominent turned to industries such as fishing, sealing, and whaling (De Pass Brothers) and ostrich breeding (the Mosenthal family). Later, they were almost forced into the Kimberley diamond industries where, however, they never achieved such pre-eminence as Barnato and Beit.

50 “South Africa concentrated almost all its peacetime industrial energy on the production of gold. The average investor put his money into gold because it offered the quickest and biggest returns. But South Africa also has tremendous deposits of iron ore, copper, asbestos, manganese, tin, lead, platinum, chrome, mica and graphite. These, along with the coal mines and the handful of factories producing consumer goods, were known as ‘secondary’ industries. The investing public’s interest in them was limited. And development of these secondary industries was discouraged by the goldmining companies and to a large extent by the government” (James, op. cit., p. 333).

54 Between 1924 and 1930, 12,319 Jews immigrated to South Africa while only 461 left the country. These figures are very striking if one considers that the total immigration for the same period after deduction of emigrants amounted to 14,241 persons. (See Schultze, op. cit.) If we compare these figures with the immigration table of note 6, it follows that Jews constituted roughly one-third of the total immigration to South Africa in the twenties, and that they, in sharp contrast to all other categories of uitlanders, settled there permanently; their share in the annual emigration is less than 2 per cent.

57 More than 100,000 Indian coolies were imported to the sugar plantations of Natal in the nineteenth century. These were followed by Chinese laborers in the mines who numbered about 55,000 in 1907. In 1910, the British government ordered the repatriation of all Chinese mine laborers, and in 1913 it prohibited any further immigration from India or any other part of Asia. In 1931, 142,000 Asiatics were still in the Union and treated like African natives. (See also Schultze, op. cit.)

In a generation which saw England abandon free trade, America leave the gold standard, the Third Reich embrace autarchy, . . . South Africa’s insistence that its economic life must be organized to secure the dominant position of the white race is not seriously out of place” (Kiewiet, op. cit., pp. 224 and 245).

Some of the men of formal law felt rather uneasy as to the success of the Indian experiment. ‘If,’ they said, ‘despotism and bureaucracy work so well in India, may not that be perhaps at some time used as an argument for introducing something of the same system here?’” The government of India, at any rate, “knew well enough that it would have to justify its existence and its policy before public opinion in England, and it well knew that that public opinion would never tolerate oppression” (A. Carthill, op. cit., pp. 70 and 41–42).

86 Harold Nicolson in his Curzon: The Last Phase 1919–1925, Boston-New York, 1934, tells the following story: “Behind the lines in Flanders was a large brewery in the vats of which the private soldiers would bathe on returning from the trenches. Curzon was taken to see this dantesque exhibit. He watched with interest those hundred naked figures disporting themselves in the steam. ‘Dear me!,’ he said, ‘I had no conception that the lower classes had such white skins.’ Curzon would deny the authenticity of this story but loved it none the less” (pp. 47–48).

1 Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf (New York, 1939): In Vienna, “I laid the foundations for a world concept in general and a way of political thinking in particular which I had later only to complete in detail, but which never afterward forsook me” (p. 129).—Stalin came back to Pan-Slav slogans during the last war. The 1945 Pan-Slav Congress in Sofia, which had been called by the victorious Russians, adopted a resolution pronouncing it “not only an international political necessity to declare Russian its language of general communication and the official language of all Slav countries, but a moral necessity.” (See Aufbau, New York, April 6, 1945.) Shortly before, the Bulgarian radio had broadcast a message by the Metropolitan Stefan, vicar of the Holy Bulgarian Synod, in which he called upon the Russian people “to remember their messianic mission” and prophesied the coming “unity of the Slav people.” (See Politics, January, 1945.)

5 The Slavophile writer Danilewski, whose Russia and Europe (1871) became the standard work of Pan-Slavism, praised the Russians’ “political capacity” because of their “tremendous thousand-year-old state that still grows and whose power does not expand like the European power in a colonial way but remains always concentrated around its nucleus, Moscow.” See K. Staehlin, Geschichte Russlands von den Anfangen bis zur Gegenwart, 1923–1939, 5 vols., IV/1, 274.

Pan-Slavism, the first of the panisms (see Hoetzsch, Russland, Berlin, 1913, p. 439), expressed these geopolitical theories almost forty years before Pan-Germanism began to “think in continents.” The contrast between English sea power and continental land power was so conspicuous that it would be far-fetched to look for influences.

See Deutsche Politik. 1. Heft: Das Deutsche Reich als Nationalstaat, 1905, p. 62. This is the chief difference between the Pan-German League, founded in 1886, and earlier colonial societies such as the Central-Verein fur Handelsgeographie (founded in 1863).

23 When Schoenerer, with his admiration for Bismarck, declared in 1876 that “Austria as a great power must cease” (Pichl, op. cit., I, 90), Bismarck thought and told his Austrian admirers that “a powerful Austria is a vital necessity to Germany.” See F. A. Neuschaefer, Georg Ritter von Schoenerer (Dissertation), Hamburg, 1935. The Czars’ attitude toward Pan-Slavism was much more equivocal because the Pan Slav conception of the state included strong popular support for despotic government Yet even under such tempting circumstances, the Czar refused to support the expansionist demand of the Slavophiles and their successors.

32 Interesting in this context are the socialist propositions of Karl Renner and Otto Bauer in Austria to separate nationality entirely from its territorial basis and to make it a kind of personal status; this of course corresponded to a situation in which ethnic groups were dispersed all over the empire without losing any of their national character. See Otto Bauer, Die Nationalitätenfrage und die österreichische Sozialdemokratie, Vienna, 1907, on the personal (as opposed to the territorial) principle, pp. 332 ff., 353 ff. “The personal principle wants to organize nations not as territorial bodies but as mere associations of persons.”

34 No full-fledged pan-movement ever developed except under these conditions. Pan-Latinism was a misnomer for a few abortive attempts of the Latin nations to make some kind of alliance against the German danger, and even Polish Messianism never claimed more than what at some time might conceivably have been Polish-dominated territory. See also Deckert, op. cit., who stated in 1944: “that Pan-Latinism has declined more and more, and that nationalism and state consciousness have become stronger and retained a greater potential there than anywhere else in Europe” (p. 7).

Are the decadent or half-bestial Russian peasant of the mir, the Negro of East-Africa, the half-breed of German South-West Africa, or the unbearable Jews of Galicia and Rumania all members of mankind? . . . One can believe in the solidarity of the Germanic peoples—whoever is outside this sphere does not matter to us.”

42 It was this shrinking of geographic distances that found an expression in Friedrich Naumann’s Central Europe: “The day is still distant when there shall be ‘one fold and one shepherd,’ but the days are past when shepherds without number, lesser or greater, drove their flocks unrestrained over the pastures of Europe. The spirit of large-scale industry and of super-national organisation has seized politics. People think, as Cecil Rhodes once expressed it, ‘in Continents.’” These few sentences were quoted in innumerable articles and pamphlets of the time.

If only France is happy, then the rest of the world can be satisfied even though they have to pay for France’s happiness with slavery or destruction. But if France suffers, then God Himself suffers, the terrible God. . . . This is as absolute and as inevitable as the secret of predestination.” Quoted from R.

63 See especially the magnificent story in The Castle (1930) of the Barnabases, which reads like a weird travesty of a piece of Russian literature. The family is living under a curse, treated as lepers till they feel themselves such, merely because one of their pretty daughters once dared to reject the indecent advances of an important official. The plain villagers, controlled to the last detail by a bureaucracy, and slaves even in their thoughts to the whims of their all-powerful officials, had long since come to realize that to be in the right or to be in the wrong was for them a matter of pure “fate” which they could not alter. It is not, as K. naïvely assumes, the sender of an obscene letter who is exposed, but the recipient who becomes branded and tainted. This is what the villagers mean when they speak of their “fate.” In K.’s view, “it’s unjust and monstrous, but [he is] the only one in the village of that opinion.”

Russians, and precisely the disciples of these authors, . . . publish books and edit magazines that are read in all European countries; through them, these ideas—the ideas of their spiritual fathers—are represented.

70 Pobyedonostzev in his Reflections of a Russian Statesman, London, 1898: “Power exists not for itself alone but for the love of God. It is a service to which men are dedicated. Thence comes the limitless, terrible strength of power and its limitless and terrible burden” (p. 254). Or: “The law becomes a snare not only to the people, but . . . to the very authorities engaged in its administration . . . if at every step the executor of the law finds in the law itself restrictive prescriptions . . . then all authority is lost in doubt, weakened by the law . . . and crushed by the fear of responsibility” (p. 88).

71 According to Katkov “government in Russia means a thing totally different from what is understood by this term in other countries. . . . In Russia the government in the highest sense of the word, is the Supreme Power in action. . . .” Moissaye J. Olgin, The Soul of the Russian Revolution, New York, 1917, p. 57.—In a more rationalized form, we find the theory that “legal guarantees were needed in states founded upon conquest and threatened by the conflict of classes and races; they were superfluous in a Russia with harmony of classes and friendship of races” (Hans Kohn, op. cit.).

Although idolization of power played a less articulate role in Pan-Germanism, there was always a certain antilegal tendency which for instance comes out clearly in Frymann, op. cit., who as early as 1912 proposed the introduction of that “protective custody” (Sicherheitsliaft), that is, arrest without any legal reason, which the Nazis then used to fill concentration camps.

72 There is of course a patent similarity between the French mob organization during the Dreyfus Affair (see p. 111) and Russian pogrom groups such as the “Black Hundreds” in which the “wildest and the least cultivated dregs of old Russia [were gathered and which] kept contact with the majority of the Orthodox episcopate” (Fedotow, op. cit.)—or the “League of the Russian People” with its secret Fighting Squadrons recruited from the lower agents of the police, paid by the government, and led by intellectuals.

74 As the President of the German Kolonialverein put it in 1884. See Mary E. Townsend, Origin of Modern German Colonialism: 1871–1885, New York, 1921. The Pan-German League always insisted on its being “above the parties; this was and is a vital condition for the League” (Otto Bonhard, op. cit.). The first real party that claimed to be more than a party, namely an “imperial party,” was the National-Liberal Party in Germany under the leadership of Ernst Bassermann (Frymann, op. cit.).

In Russia, the Pan-Slavs needed only to pretend to be nothing more than popular support for the government, in order to be removed from all competition with parties; for the government as “the Supreme Power in action . . . cannot be understood as related to parties.” Thus M. N. Katkov, close journalistic collaborator of Pobyedonostzev. See Olgin, op. cit., p. 57.

75 This clearly was still the purpose of the early “beyond party” groups among which up to 1918 the Pan-German League must still be counted. “Standing outside of all organized political parties, we may go our purely national way.

77 Wertheimer, op. cit., depicts the situation quite correctly when she says: “That there was any vital connection before the war between the Pan-German League and the imperial government is entirely preposterous.” On the other hand, it was perfectly true that German policy during the first World War was decisively influenced by Pan-Germans because the higher officer corps had become Pan-German.

A complete lack of respect for Parliaments . . . which at no time have the faintest idea of what is really going on in the country . . . is very widespread among the people.”

83 The best account of the essence of the Continental party system is given by the Swiss jurist Johann Caspar Bluntschli, Charakter und Geist der politischen Parteien, 1869. He states: “It is true that a party is only part of a greater whole, never this whole itself. . . . It must never identify itself with the whole, the people or the state . . . ; therefore a party may fight against other parties, but it must never ignore them and usually must not want to destroy them. No party can exist all by itself” (p. 3). The same idea is expressed by Karl Rosenkranz, a German Hegelian philosopher, whose book on political parties appeared before parties existed in Germany: Ueber den Begriff der politischen Partei (1843): “Party is conscious partiality” (p. 9).

Rohden, Vienna, 1932, Introduction: “The distinguishing characteristic of German parties is . . . that all parliamentary groups are resigned not to represent the volonté générale. . . . That is why the parties were so embarrassed when the November Revolution brought them to power. Each of them was so organized that it could only make a relative claim, i.e., it always reckoned with the existence of other parties representing other partial interests and thus naturally limited its own ambitions” (pp. 13–14).

86 The Continental party system is of very recent date. With the exception of the French parties which date back to the French Revolution, no European country knew party representation prior to 1848. Parties came into being through formation of factions in Parliament. In Sweden, the Social Democratic Party was the first party (in 1889) with a fully formulated program (Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, loc. cit.). For Germany, see Ludwig Bergstraesser, Geschichte der politischen Parteien, 1921. All parties were frankly based upon protection of interests; the German Conservative Party for instance developed from the “Association to protect the interests of big landed property” founded in 1848. Interests were not necessarily economic, however. The Dutch parties, for instance, were formed “over the two questions that so largely dominate Dutch politics—the broadening of the franchise and the subsidizing of private [mainly denominational] education” (Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, loc. cit.).

88 Arthur N. Holcombe (Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, loc. cit.) rightly stressed that in the double party system the principles of the two parties “have tended to be the same.

89 Burke, op. cit.: “They believed that no men could act with effect, who did not act in concert; that no men could act in concert, who did not act with confidence; that no men could act with confidence, who were not bound together by common opinions, common affections, and common interests.”

90 For the Central European concept of citizen (the Staatsbürger) as opposed to party member, see Bluntschli, op. cit.: “Parties are not state institutions, . . . not members of the state organism, but free social associtions whose formations depend upon a changing membership united for common political action by a definite conviction.” The difference between state and party interest is stressed time and again: “The party must never put itself above the state, must never put its party interest above the state interest” (pp. 9 and 10).

Burke, on the contrary, argues against the concept according to which party interests or party membership make a man a worse citizen. “Commonwealths are made of families, free commonwealths of parties also; and we may as well affirm that our natural regards and ties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens, as that the bonds of our party weaken those by which we are held to our country” (op. cit.). Lord John Russell, On Party (1850), even goes one step further when he asserts that the chief of the good effects of parties is “that it gives a substance to the shadowy opinions of politicians, and attaches them to steady and lasting principles.”

91 Compare with this attitude the telling fact that in Great Britain Ramsay MacDonald was never able to live down his “betrayal” of the Labor Party. In Germany the spirit of civil service asked of those in public office to be “above the parties.” Against this spirit of the old Prussian civil service the Nazis asserted the priority of the Party, because they wanted dictatorship. Goebbels demanded explicitly: “Each party member who becomes a state functionary has to remain a National Socialist first . . . and to co-operate closely with the party administration” (quoted from Gottfried Neesse, Partei und Stoat, 1939, p. 28).

94 The main purpose of the corporate state was “that of correcting and neutralizing a condition brought about by the industrial revolution of the nineteenth century which dissociated capital and labor in industry, giving rise on the one hand to a capitalist class of employers of labor and on the other to a great propertyless class, the industrial proletariat. The juxtaposition of these classes inevitably led to the clash of their opposing interests” (The Fascist Era, published by the Fascist Confederation of Industrialists, Rome, 1939, Chapter iii).

95 “If the State is truly to represent the nation, then the people composing the nation must be part of the State.

2 The early persecution of German Jews by the Nazis must be considered as an attempt to spread antisemitism among “those peoples who are friendlily disposed to Jews, above all the Western democracies” rather than as an effort to get rid of the Jews. A circular letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to all German authorities abroad shortly after the November pogroms of 1938, stated: “The emigration movement of only about 100,000 Jews has already sufficed to awaken the interest of many countries in the Jewish danger. . . . Germany is very interested in maintaining the dispersal of Jewry . . . the influx of Jews in all parts of the world invokes the opposition of the native population and thereby forms the best propaganda for the German Jewish policy. . . . The poorer and therefore more burdensome the immigrating Jew is to the country absorbing him, the stronger the country will react.” See Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Washington, 1946, published by the U. S. Government, VI, 87 ff.

6 This term was first coined by Otto Bauer, Die Nationalitätenfrage und die österreichische Sozialdemokratie, Vienna, 1907.

Historical consciousness played a great role in the formation of national consciousness. The emancipation of nations from dynastic rule and the overlordship of an international aristocracy was accompanied by the emancipation of literature from the “international” language of the learned (Latin first and later French) and the growth of national languages out of the popular vernacular. It seemed that peoples whose language was fit for literature had reached national maturity per definitionem. The liberation movements of Eastern European nationalities, therefore, started with a kind of philological revival (the results were sometimes grotesque and sometimes very fruitful) whose political function it was to prove that the people who possessed a literature and a history of their own, had the right to national sovereignty.

7 Of course this was not always a clear-cut alternative. So far nobody has bothered to find out the characteristic similarities between colonial and minority exploitation. Only Jacob Robinson, “Staatsbürgerliche und wirtschaftliche Gleichberechtigung” in Süddeutsche Monatshefte, 26: Jahrgang, July, 1929, remarks in passing: “A peculiar economic protectionism appeared, not directed against other countries but against certain groups of the population. Surprisingly, certain methods of colonial exploitation could be observed in Central Europe.”

8 It has been estimated that prior to 1914 there were about 100 million people whose national aspirations had not been fulfilled. (See Charles Kingsley Webster, “Minorities: History,” in Encyclopedia Britannica, 1929.) The population of minorities was estimated approximately between 25 and 30 millions. (P. de Azcarate, “Minorities: League of Nations,” ibid.). The actual situation in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia was much worse. In the former, the Czech “state people” constituted, with 7,200,000, about 50 per cent of the population, and in the latter 5,000,000 Serbs formed only 42 per cent of the total. See W. Winkler, Statistisches Handbuch der europäischen Nationalitäten, Vienna, 1931; Otto Junghann, National Minorities in Europe, 1932. Slightly different figures are given by Tramples, op. cit.

10 The French and the British delegates were most outspoken in this respect. Said Briand: “The process at which we should aim is not the disappearance of the minorities, but a kind of assimilation. . . .” And Sir Austen Chamberlain, British representative, even claimed that “the object of the Minority Treaties [is] . . . to secure . . . that measure of protection and justice which would gradually prepare them to be merged in the national community to which they belonged” (C. A. Macartney, National States and National Minorities, London, 1934, pp. 276, 277).

11 It is true that some Czech statesmen, the most liberal and democratic of the leaders of national movements, once dreamed of making the Czechoslovak republic a kind of Switzerland. The reason why even Bene? never serious attempted to effectuate such a solution to his harassing nationality problems was that Switzerland was not a model that could be imitated, but rather a particularly fortunate exception that proved an otherwise established rule. The newly established states did not feel secure enough to abandon a centralized state apparatus and could not create overnight those small self-administrative bodies of communes and cantons upon whose very extensive powers the Swiss system of federation is based.

12 Wilson notably, who had been a fervent advocate of granting “racial, religious, and linguistic rights to the minorities,” “feared that ‘national rights’ would prove harmful inasmuch as minority groups thus marked as separate corporate bodies would be rendered thereby ‘liable to jealousy and attack’” (Oscar J. Janowsky, The Jews and Minority Rights, New York, 1933, p. 351).

15 In 1933 the chairman of the Congress expressly emphasized: “One thing is certain: we do not meet in our congresses merely as members of abstract minorities; each of us belongs body and soul to a specific people, his own, and feels himself tied to the fate of that people for better or worse. Consequently, each of us stands here, if I may say so, as a full-blooded German or full-blooded Jew, as a full-blooded Hungarian or full-blooded Ukrainian.” See Sitzungsbericht des Kongresses der organisierten nationalen Gruppen in den Staaten Europas, 1933, p. 8.

16 The first minorities arose when the Protestant principle of freedom of conscience accomplished the suppression of the principle cuius regio eius religio. The Congress of Vienna in 1815 had already taken steps to secure certain rights to the Polish populations in Russia, Prussia, and Austria, rights that certainly were not merely “religious”; it is, however, characteristic that all later treaties—the protocol guaranteeing the independence of Greece in 1830, the one guaranteeing the independence of Moldavia and Wallachia in 1856, and the Congress of Berlin in 1878 concerned with Rumania—speak of “religious,” and not “national” minorities, which were granted “civil” but not “political” rights.

17 De Mello Franco, representative of Brazil on the Council of the League of Nations, put the problem very clearly: “It seems to me obvious that those who conceived this system of protection did not dream of creating within certain States a group of inhabitants who would regard themselves as permanently foreign to the general organization of the country” (Macartney, op. cit., p. 277).

18 “The regime for the protection of minorities was designed to provide a remedy in cases where a territorial settlement was inevitably imperfect from the point of view of nationality” (Joseph Roucek, The Minority Principle as a Problem of Political Science, Prague, 1928, p. 29). The trouble was that imperfection of territorial settlement was the fault not only in the minority settlements but in the establishment of the succession states themselves, since there was no territory in this region to which several nationalities could not lay claim.

19 An almost symbolic evidence of this change of mind can be found in statements of President Eduard Beneš of Czechoslovakia, the only country that after the first World War had submitted with good grace to the obligations of the Minority Treaties. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II Beneš began to lend his support to the principle of transfer of populations, which finally led to the expulsion of the German minority and the addition of another category to the growing mass of Displaced Persons. For Beneš’ stand, see Oscar J. Janowsky, Nationalities and National Minorities, New York, 1945, pp. 136 ff.

20 “The problem of statelessness became prominent after the Great War. Before the war, provisions existed in some countries, notably in the United States, under which naturalization could be revoked in those cases in which the naturalized person ceased to maintain a genuine attachment to his adopted country. A person so denaturalized became stateless. During the war, the principal European States found it necessary to amend their laws of nationality so as to take power to cancel naturalization” (John Hope Simpson, The Refugee Problem, Institute of International Affairs, Oxford, 1939, p. 231). The class of stateless persons created through revocation of naturalization was very small; they established, however, an easy precedent so that, in the interwar period, naturalized citizens were as a rule the first section of a population that became stateless. Mass cancellation of naturalizations, such as the one introduced by Nazi Germany in 1933 against all naturalized Germans of Jewish origin, usually preceded denationalization of citizens by birth in similar categories, and the introduction of laws that made denaturalization possible through simple decree, like the ones in Belgium and other Western democracies in the thirties, usually preceded actual mass denaturalization; a good instance is the practice of the Greek government with respect to the Armenian refugees: of 45,000 Armenian refugees 1,000 were naturalized between 1923 and 1928. After 1928, a law which would have naturalized all refugees under twenty-two years of age was suspended, and in 1936, all naturalizations were canceled by the government. (See Simpson, op. cit., p. 41.)

21 Twenty-five years after the Soviet regime had disowned one and a half million Russians, it was estimated that at least 350,000 to 450,000 were still stateless—which is a tremendous percentage if one considers that a whole generation had passed since the initial flight, that a considerable portion had gone overseas, and that another large part had acquired citizenship in different countries through marriage. (See Simpson, op. cit., p. 559; Eugene M. Kulischer, The Displacement of Population in Europe, Montreal, 1943; Winifred N. Hadsel, “Can Europe’s Refugees Find New Homes?” in Foreign Policy Reports, August, 1943, Vol. X, no. 10.)

It is true that the United States has placed stateless immigrants on a footing of complete equality with other foreigners, but this has been possible only because this, the country par excellence of immigration, has always considered newcomers as prospective citizens of its own, regardless of their former national allegiances.

24 An Italian law of 1926 against “abusive emigration” seemed to foreshadow denaturalization measures against anti-Fascist refugees; however, after 1929 the denaturalization policy was abandoned and Fascist organizations abroad were introduced. Of the 40,000 members of the Unione Popolare Italiana in France, at least 10,000 were authentic anti-Fascist refugees, but only 3,000 were without passports. See Simpson, op. cit., pp. 122 ff.

25 The first law of this type was a French war measure in 1915 which concerned only naturalized citizens of enemy origin who had retained their original nationality; Portugal went much farther in a decree of 1916 which automatically denaturalized all persons born of a German father. Belgium issued a law in 1922 which canceled naturalization of persons who had committed antinational acts during the war, and reaffirmed it by a new decree in 1934 which in the characteristically vague manner of the time spoke of persons “manqitant gravement a leurs devoirs de citoyen beige.” In Italy, since 1926, all persons could be denaturalized who were not’”worthy of Italian citizenship” or a menace to the public order. Egypt and Turkey in 1926 and 1928 respectively issued laws according to which people could be denaturalized who were a threat to the social order. France threatened with denaturalization those of its new citizens who committed acts contrary to the interests of France (1927). Austria in 1933 could deprive of Austrian nationality any of her citizens who served or participated abroad in an action hostile to Austria. Germany, finally, in 1933 followed closely the various Russian nationality decrees since 1921 by stating that all persons “residing abroad” could at will be deprived of German nationality.

26 S. Lawford Childs (op. cit.) deplores the fact that the Covenant of the League contained “no charter for political refugees, no solace for exiles.” The most recent attempt of the United Nations to obtain, at least for a small group of stateless—the so-called “de jure stateless”—an improvement of their legal status was no more than a mere gesture: namely, to gather the representatives of at least twenty states, but with the explicit assurance that participation in such a conference would entail no obligations whatsoever. Even under these circumstances it remained extremely doubtful whether the conference could be called. See the news item in the New York Times, October 17, 1954, p. 9.

27 The only guardians of the right of asylum were the few societies whose special aim was the protection of human rights. The most important of them, the French-sponsored Ligue des Droits de l’Homme with branches in all democratic European countries, behaved as though the question were still merely the saving of individuals persecuted for their political convictions and activities. This assumption, pointless already in the case of millions of Russian refugees, became simply absurd for Jews and Armenians. The Ligue was neither ideologically nor administratively equipped to handle the new problems. Since it did not want to face the new situation, it stumbled into functions which were much better fulfilled by any of the many charity agencies which the refugees had built up themselves with the help of their compatriots. When the Rights of Man became the object of an especially inefficient charity organization, the concept of human rights naturally was discredited a little more.

28 The many and varied efforts of the legal profession to simplify the problem by stating a difference between the stateless person and the refugee—such as maintaining “that the status of a stateless person is characterized by the fact of his having no nationality, whereas that of a refugee is determined by his having lost diplomatic protection” (Simpson, op. cit., p. 232)—were always defeated by the fact that “all refugees are for practical purposes stateless” (Simpson, op. cit., p. 4).

29 The most ironical formulation of this general expectation was made by R. Yewdall Jermings, “Some International Aspects of the Refugee Question” in British Yearbook of International Law, 1939: “The status of a refugee is not, of course, a permanent one. The aim is that he should rid himself of that status as soon as possible, either by repatriation or by naturalization in the country of refuge.”

30 Only the Russians, in every respect the aristocracy of the stateless people, and the Armenians, who were assimilated to the Russian status, were ever officially recognized as “stateless,” placed under the protection of the League of Nations’ Nansen Office, and given traveling papers.

31 Childs, op. cit. The reason for this desperate attempt at promptness was the fear of all governments that even the smallest positive gesture “might encourage countries to get rid of their unwanted people and that many might emigrate who would otherwise remain in their countries even under serious disabilities” (Louise W. Holborn, “The Legal Status of Political Refugees, 1920–38,” in American Journal of International Law, 1938).

See also Georges Mauco (in Esprit, 7e année, No. 82, July, 1939, p. 590): “An assimilation of the German refugees to the status of other refugees who were taken care of by the Nansen office would naturally have been the simplest and best solution for the German refugees themselves. But the governments did not want to extend the privileges already granted to a new category of refugees who, moreover, threatened to increase their number indefinitely.”

32 To the 600,000 Jews in Germany and Austria who were potentially stateless in 1938, must be added the Jews of Rumania (the president of the Rumanian Federal Commission for Minorities, Professor Dragomir, having just announced to the world the impending revision of the citizenship of all Rumanian Jews) and Poland (whose foreign minister Beck had officially declared that Poland had one million Jews too many). See Simpson, op. cit., p. 235.

33 It is difficult to decide what came first, the nation-states’ reluctance to naturalize refugees (the practice of naturalization became increasingly restricted and the practice of denaturalization increasingly common with the arrival of refugees) or the refugees’ reluctance to accept another citizenship. In countries with minority populations like Poland, the refugees (Russians and Ukrainians) had a definite tendency to assimilate to the minorities without however demanding Polish citizenship. (See Simpson, op. cit., p. 364.)

The behavior of Russian refugees is quite characteristic. The Nansen passport described its bearer as “personne d’origine russe,” because “one would not have dared to tell the Russian émigré that he was without nationality or of doubtful nationality.” (See Marc Vichniac, “Le Statut International des Apatrides,” in Recueil des Cours de l’Académie de Droit International, Vol. XXXIII, 1933.) An attempt to provide all stateless persons with uniform identity cards was bitterly contested by the holders of Nansen passports, who claimed that their passport was “a sign of legal recognition of their peculiar status.” (See Jermings, op. cit.) Before the outbreak of the war even refugees from Germany were far from eager to be merged with the mass of the stateless, but preferred the description “réfugié provenant d’Allemagne” with its remnant of nationality.

More convincing than the complaints of European countries about the difficulties of assimilating refugees are statements from overseas which agree with the former that “of all classes of European immigrants the least easy to assimilate are the South, Eastern, and Central Europeans.” (See “Canada and the Doctrine of Peaceful Changes,” edited by H. F. Angus in International Studies Conference: Demographic Questions: Peaceful Changes, 1937, pp. 75–76.)

35 A circular letter of the Dutch authorities (May 7, 1938) expressly considered each refugee as an “undesirable alien,” and defined a refugee as an “alien who left his country under the pressure of circumstances.” See “L’Emigration, Problème Révolutionnaire,” in Esprit, 7e année, No. 82, July, 1939, p. 602.

36 Lawrence Preuss, op. cit., describes the spread of illegality as follows: “The initial illegal act of the denationalizing government . . . puts the expelling country in the position of an offender of international law, because its authorities violate the law of the country to which the stateless person is expelled. The latter country, in turn, cannot get rid of him . . . except by violating . . . the law of a third country. . . . [The stateless person finds himself before the following alternative]: either he violates the law of the country where he resides . . . or he violates the law of the country to which he is expelled.”

Sir John Fischer Williams (“Denationalisation,” in British Year Book of International Law, VII, 1927) concludes from this situation that denationalization is contrary to international law; yet at the Conference pour la Codification du Droit International at the Hague in 1930, it was only the Finnish government which maintained that “loss of nationality . . . should never constitute a punishment . . . nor be pronounced in order to get rid of an undesirable person through expulsion.”

37 Childs, op. cit., after having come to the sad conclusion that “the real difficulty about receiving a refugee is that if he turns out badly . . . there is no way of getting rid of him,” proposed “transitional centers” to which the refugee could be returned even from abroad, which, in other words, should replace a homeland for deportation purposes.

38 Two instances of mass naturalization in the Near East were clearly exceptional: one involved Greek refugees form Trukey whom the Greek government naturalized en bloc in 1922 because it was actually a matter of repatriation of a Greek minority and not of foreign citizens; the other benefited Armenian refugees from Turkey in Syria, Lebanon, and other formerly Turkish countries, that is, a population with which the Near East had shared common citizenship only a few years ago.

39 Where a wave of refugees found members of their own nationality already settled in the country to which they immigrated—as was the case with the Armenians and Italians in France, for example, and with Jews everywhere—a certain retrogression set in in the assimilation of those who had been there longer. For their help and solidarity could be mobilized only by appealing to the original nationality they had in common with the newcomers. This point was of immediate interest to countries flooded by refugees but unable or unwilling to give them direct help or the right to work. In all these cases, national feelings of the older group proved to be “one of the main factors in the successful establishment of the refugees” (Simpson, op. cit., pp. 45–46), but by appealing to such national conscience and solidarity, the receiving countries naturally increased the number of unassimilated aliens. To take one particularly interesting instance, 10,000 Italian refugees were enough to postpone indefinitely the assimilation of almost one million Italian immigrants in France.

40 The French government, followed by other Western countries, introduced during the thirties an increasing number of restrictions for naturalized citizens: they were eliminated from certain professions for up to ten years after their naturalization, they had no political rights, etc.

42 In practical terms, any sentence meted out to him will be of small consequence compared with an expulsion order, cancellation of a work permit, or a decree sending him into an internment camp. A West Coast Japanese-American who was in jail when the army ordered the internment of all Americans of Japanese ancestry would not have been forced to liquidate his property at too low a price; he would have remained right where he was, armed with a lawyer to look after his interests; and if he was so lucky as to receive a long sentence, he might have returned righteously and peacefully to his former business and profession, even that of a professional thief. His jail sentence guaranteed him the constitutional rights that nothing else—no protests of loyalty and no appeals—could have obtained for him once his citizenship had become doubtful.

44 In France, for instance, it was a matter of record that an order of expulsion emanating from the police was much more serious than one which was issued “only” by the Ministry of Interior and that the Minister of Interior could only in rare cases cancel a police expulsion, while the opposite procedure was often merely a question of bribery. Constitutionally, the police is under the authority of the Ministry of Interior.

44a “In February, 1938, the Reich and Prussian Ministry of Interior presented the “draft of a law concerning the acquisition and loss of German nationality” which went far beyond the Nuremberg legislation. It provided that all children of “Jews, Jews of mixed blood or persons of otherwise alien blood” (who could never become Reich citizens anyway) were also no longer entitled to the nationality, “even if the father possesses German nationality by birth.” That these measures were no longer merely concerned with anti-Jewish legislation is evident from an opinion expressed July 19, 1939. by the Minister of Justice, who suggests that “the words Jew and Jew of mixed blood should if possible be avoided in the law, to be replaced by ‘persons of alien blood,’ or ‘persons of non-German or non-Germanic [nicht artverwandt] blood.’” An interesting feature in planning this extraordinary expansion of the stateless population in Nazi Germany concerns the foundlings, who are explicitly regarded as stateless, until “an investigation of their racial characteristics can be made.” Here the principle that every individual is born with inalienable rights guaranteed by his nationality has been deliberately reversed: every individual is born rightless, namely stateless, unless subsequently other conclusions are reached.

The original dossier concerning the draft of this legislation, including the opinions of all Ministries and the Wehrmacht High Command, can be found in the archives of the Yiddish Scientific Institute in New York (G-75).

46 This was by no means only a notion of Nazi Germany, though only a Nazi author dared to express it: “It is true that a refugee question will continue to exist even when there is no longer a Jewish question; but since Jews form such a high percentage of the refugees, the refugee question will be much simplified” (Kabermann, “Das Internationale Flüchtlingsproblem,” in Zeitschrift für Politik, Bd. 29, Heft 3, 1939).

47 Pathetic instances of this exclusive confidence in national rights were the consent, before the second World War, of nearly 75 per cent of the German minority in the Italian Tyrol to leave their homes and resettle in Germany, the voluntary repatriation of a German island in Slovenia which had been there since the fourteenth century or, immediately after the close of the war, the unanimous rejection by Jewish refugees in an Italian DP camp of an offer of mass naturalization by the Italian government. In the face of the experience of European peoples between the two wars, it would be a serious mistake to interpret this behavior simply as another example of fanatic nationalist sentiment; these people no longer felt sure of their elementary rights if these were not protected by a government to which they belonged by birth.

48 The few chances for reintegration open to the new migrants were mostly based on their nationality: Spanish refugees, for instance, were welcomed to a certain extent in Mexico. The United States, in the early twenties, adopted a quota system according to which each nationality already represented in the country received, so to speak, the right to receive a number of former countrymen proportionate to its numerical part in the total population.

49 How dangerous it can be to be innocent from the point of view of the persecuting government, became very clear when, during the last war, the American government offered asylum to all those German refugees who were threatened by the extradition paragraph in the German-French Armistice. The condition was, of course, that the applicant could prove that he had done something against the Nazi regime. The proportion of refugees from Germany who were able to fulfill this condition was very small, and they, strangely enough, were not the people who were most in danger.

54 This modern expulsion from humanity has much more radical consequences than the ancient and medieval custom of outlawry. Outlawry, certainly the “most fearful fate which primitive law could inflict,” placing the life of the outlawed person at the mercy of anyone he met, disappeared with the establishment of an effective system of law enforcement and was finally replaced by extradition treaties between the nations. It had been primarily a substitute for a police force, designed to compel criminals to surrender.

The early Middle Ages seem to have been quite conscious of the danger involved in “civil death.” Excommunication in the late Roman Empire meant ecclesiastical death but left a person who had lost his membership in the church full freedom in all other respects. Ecclesiastical and civil death became identical only in the Merovingian era, and there excommunication “in general practice [was] limited to temporary withdrawal or suspension of the rights of membership which might be regained.” See the articles “Outlawry” and “Excommunication” in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences. Also the article “Friedlosigkeit” in the Schweizer Lexikon.

1 The “magic spell” that Hitler cast over his listeners has been acknowledged many times, latterly by the publishers of Hitlers Tischgespräche, Bonn, 1951 (Hitler’s Table Talks, American edition, New York, 1953; quotations from the original German edition). This fascination—“the strange magnetism that radiated from Hitler in such a compelling manner”—rested indeed “on the fanatical belief of this man in himself” (introduction by Gerhard Ritter, p. 14), on his pseudo-authoritative judgments about everything under the sun, and on the fact that his opinions—whether they dealt with the harmful effects of smoking or with Napoleon’s policies—could always be fitted into an all-encompassing ideology.

Fascination is a social phenomenon, and the fascination Hitler exercised over his environment must be understood in terms of the particular company he kept. Society is always prone to accept a person offhand for what he pretends to be, so that a crackpot posing as a genius always has a certain chance to be believed. In modern society, with its characteristic lack of discerning judgment, this tendency is strengthened, so that someone who not only holds opinions but also presents them in a tone of unshakable conviction will not so easily forfeit his prestige, no matter how many times he has been demonstrably wrong. Hitler, who knew the modern chaos of opinions from first-hand experience, discovered that the helpless seesawing between various opinions and “the conviction . . . that everything is balderdash” (p. 281) could best be avoided by adhering to one of the many current opinions with “unbending consistency.” The hair-raising arbitrariness of such fanaticism holds great fascination for society because for the duration of the social gathering it is freed from the chaos of opinions that it constantly generates. This “gift” of fascination, however, has only social relevance; it is so prominent in the Tischgespräche because here Hitler played the game of society and was not speaking to his own kind but to the generals of the Wehrmacht, all of whom more or less belonged to “society.” To believe that Hitler’s successes were based on his “powers of fascination” is altogether erroneous; with those qualities alone he would have never advanced beyond the role of a prominent figure in the salons.

4 The best study of Hitler and his career is the new Hitler biography by Alan Bullock, Hitler, A Study in Tyranny, London, 1952. In the English tradition of political biographies it makes meticulous use of all available source material and gives a comprehensive picture of the contemporary political background. By this publication the excellent books of Konrad Heiden—primarily Der Fuehrer: Hitler’s Rise to Power, Boston, 1944—have been superseded in their details although they remain important for the general interpretation of events. For Stalin’s career, Boris Souvarine, Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism, New York, 1939, is still a standard work. Isaac Deutscher, Stalin: A Political Biography, New York and London, 1949, is indispensable for its rich documentary material and great insight into the internal struggles of the Bolshevik party; it suffers from an interpretation which likens Stalin to—Cromwell, Napoleon, and Robespierre.

7 This, to be sure, is a specialty of the Russian brand of totalitarianism. It is interesting to note that in the early trial of foreign engineers in the Soviet Union, Communist sympathies were already used as an argument for self-accusation: “All the time the authorities insisted on my admitting having committed acts of sabotage I had never done. I refused. I was told: if you are in favour of the Soviet Government, as you pretend you are, prove it by your actions; the Government needs your confession.’” Reported by Anton Ciliga, The Russian Enigma, London, 1940, p. 153.

A theoretical justification for this behavior was given by Trotsky: “We can only be right with and by the Party, for history has provided no other way of being in the right. The English have a saying, ‘My country, right or wrong.’ . . . We have much better historical justification in saying whether it is right or wrong in certain individual concrete cases, it is my party” (Souvarine, op. cit., p. 361).

On the other hand, the Red Army officers who did not belong to the movement had to be tried behind closed doors.

8 The Nazi author Andreas Pfenning explicitly rejects the notion that the SA were fighting for an “ideal” or were prompted by and “idealistic experience.” Their “basic experience came into existance in the course of the struggle.” “Gemeinschaft und Staatswissenschaft,” in Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft, Band 96. Translation quoted from Ernst Fraenkel, The Dual State, New York and London, 1941. p. 192. From the extensive literature issued in pamphlet form by the main indoctrination center (Hauptamt-Schulungsamt) of the SS, it is quite evident that the word “idealism” has been studiously avoided. Not idealism was demanded of SS members, but “utter logical consistency in all question of ideology and the ruthless pursuit of the political struggle” (Werner Best, Die deutsche Polizei, 1941, p. 99).

9 In this respect postwar Germany offers many illuminating examples. It was astonishing enough that American Negro troops were by no means received with hostility, in spite of the massive racial indoctrination undertaken by the Nazis. But equally startling was “the fact that the Waffen-SS in the last days of German resistance against the Allies did not fight ‘to the last man’” and that this special Nazi combat unit “after the enormous sacrifices of the preceding years, which far exceeded the proportionate losses of the wehrmacht, in the last few weeks acted like any unit drawn from the ranks of civilians, and bowed to the hopelessness of the situation” (Karl O. Paetel, “Die SS,” in Vierteljahreshefte für Zeitgeschichte, January, 1954).

11 Proof of the nontotalitarian nature of the Fascist dictatorship is the surprisingly small number and the comparatively mild sentences meted out to political offenders. During the particularly active years from 1926 to 1932, the special tribunals for political offenders pronounced 7 death sentences, 257 sentences of 10 or more years imprisonment, 1,360 under 10 years, and sentenced many more to exile; 12,000, moreover, were arrested and found innocent, a procedure quite inconceivable under condition of Nazi or Bolshevik terror.

12 Nazi political theorists have always emphatically stated that “Mussolini’s ‘ethical state’ and Hitler’s ‘ideological state’ [Weltanschauungsstaat] cannot be mentioned in the same breath” (Gottfried Neesse, “Die verfassungsrechtliche Gestaltung der Ein-Partei,” in Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft, 1938, Band 98).

Goebbels on the difference between Fascism and National Socialism: “[Fascism] is . . . nothing like National Socialism. While the latter goes deep down to the roots, Fascism is only a superficial thing” (The Goebbels Diaries 1942–1943, ed. by Louis Lochner, New York, 1948, p. 71). “[The Duce] is not a revolutionary like the Führer or Stalin. He is so bound to his own Italian people that he lacks the broad qualities of a worldwide revolutionary and insurrectionist” (ibid., p. 468).

Himmler expressed the same opinion in a speech delivered in 1943 at a Conference of Commanding Officers: “Fascism and National Socialism are two fundamentally different things, . . . there is absolutely no comparison between Fascism and National Socialism as spiritual, ideological movements.” See Kohn-Bramstedt, op. cit., Appendix A.

Hitler recognized in the early twenties the affinity between the Nazi and the Communist movements: “In our movement the two extremes come together: the Communists from the Left and the officers and the students from the Right. These two have always been the most active elements. . . . The Communists were the idealists of Socialism. . . .” See Heiden, op. cit., p. 147. Röhm, the chief of the SA, only repeated a current opinion when he wrote in the late twenties: “Many things are between us and the Communists, but we respect the sincerity of their conviction and their willingness to bring sacrifices for their own cause, and this unites us with them” (Ernst Röhm, Die Geschichte eines Hochverräters, 1933, Volksausgabe, p. 273).

During the last war, the Nazis more readily recognized the Russians as their peers than any other nation. Hitler, speaking in May, 1943, at a conference of the Reichsleiter and Gauleiter, “began with the fact that in this war bourgeoisie and revolutionary states are facing each other. It has been an easy thing for us to knock out the bourgeois states, for they were quite inferior to us in their upbringing and attitude. Countries with an ideology have an edge on bourgois states. . . . [In the East] we met an opponent who also sponsors an ideology, even though a wrong one. . . .” (Goebbels Diaries, p. 355).—This estimate was based on ideological, not on military considerations. Gottfried Neesse, Partei und Staat, 1936, gave the official version of the movement’s struggle for power when he wrote: “For us the united front of the system extends from the German National People’s Party [i.e., the extreme Right] to the Social Democrats. The Communist Party was an enemy outside of the system. During the first months of 1933, therefore, when the doom of the system was already sealed, we still had to fight a decisive battle against the Communist Party” (p. 76).

Krivitsky, whose excellent confidential source of information is the GPU: ‘Instead of the 171 million inhabitants calculated for 1937, only 145 million were found; thus nearly 30 million people in the USSR are missing.”’ And this, it should be kept in mind, occurred after the dekulakization of the early thirties which had cost an estimated 8 million human lives.

16 A large part of these plans, based on the original documents, can be found in Léon Poliakov’s Bréviaire de la Haine, Paris, 1951, chapter 8 (American edition under the title Harvest of Hate, Syracuse, 1954; we quote from the original French edition), but only insofar as they referred to the extermination of non-Germanic peoples, above all those of Slavic origin. That the Nazi engine of destruction would not have stopped even before the German people is evident from a Reich health bill drafted by Hitler himself. Here he proposes to “isolate” from the rest of the population all families with cases of heart or lung ailments among them, their physical liquidation being of course the next step in this program. This as well as several other interesting projects for a victorious postwar Germany are contained in a circular letter to the district leaders (Kreisleiter) of Hesse-Nassau in the form of a report on a discussion at the Fuehrer’s headquarters concerning “measures that before . . . and after victorious termination of the war” should be adopted. See the collection of documents in Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Washington, 1946, et seq., Vol. VII, p. 175. In the same context belongs the planned enactment of an “over-all alien legislation,” by means of which the “institutional authority” of the police—namely, to ship persons innocent of any offenses to concentration camps—was to be legalized and expanded. (See Paul Werner, SS-Standartenführer, in Deutsches Jugendrecht, Heft 4, 1944.)

In connection with this “negative population policy,” which in its aim at extermination decidedly matches the Bolshevist party purges, it is important to remember that “in this process of selection there can never be a standstill” (Himmler, “Die Schutzstaffel,” in Grundlagen, Aufbau und Wirlschaftsordnung des nationalsozialstischen Staates, No. 7b). “The struggle of the Fuehrer and his party was a hitherto unattained selection. . . . This selection and this struggle were ostensibly accomplished on January 30, 1933. . . . The Fuehrer and his old guard knew that the real struggle had just begun” (Robert Ley, Der Weg zur Ordensburg, o.D. Verlag der Deutschen Arbeits-front. “Not available for sale”).

17 F. Borkenau describes the situation correctly: ‘The Communists had only very modest successes when they tried to win influence among the masses of the working class; their mass basis, therefore, if they had it at all, moved more and more away from the proletariat” (“Die neue Komintern,” in Der Monat, Berlin, 1949, Heft 4).

But with the Communists they still had a majority, Hitler replied; no one can govern against us” (Heiden, op. cit., pp. 94 and 495, respectively).

25 The plot between Reichswehr General Schleicher and Röhm, the chief of the SA, consisted of a plan to bring all paramilitary formations under the military authority of the Reichswehr, which at once would have added millions to the German army. This, of course, would inevitably have led to a military dictatorship. In June, 1934, Hitler liquidated Röhm and Schleicher. The initial negotiations were started with the full knowledge of Hitler who used Röhm’s connections with the Reichswehr to deceive German military circles about his real intentions. In April, 1932, Röhm testified in one of Hitler’s lawsuits that the SA’s military status had the full understanding of the Reichswehr. (For documentary evidence on the Röhm-Schleicher plan, see Nazi Conspiracy, V, 456 ff. See also Heiden, op. cit., p. 450.) Röhm himself proudly reports his negotiations with Schleicher, which according to him were started in 1931. Schleicher had promised to put the SA under the command of Reichswehr officers in case of an emergency. (See Die Memoiren des Stabschefs Röhm, Saarbrücken, 1934, p. 170.) The militaristic character of the SA, shaped by Röhm and constantly fought by Hitler, continued to determine its vocabulary even after the liquidation of the Röhm faction. Contrary to the SS, the members of the SA always insisted on being the “representatives of Germany’s military will,” and for them the Third Reich was a “military community [supported by] two pillars: Party and Wehrmacht” (see Handbuch der SA, Berlin, 1939, and Victor Lutze, “Die Sturmabteilungen,” in Grundlagen, Aufbau und Wirtschaftsordnung des nationalsozialistischen Staates, No. 7a).

27 It is well known that the anti-Stalinist splinter groups have based their criticism of the development of the Soviet Union on this Marxist formulation, and have actually never outgrown it. The repeated “purges” of Soviet bureaucracy, which were tantamount to a liquidation of bureaucracy as a class, have never prevented them from seeing in it the dominating and ruling class of the Soviet Union. The following is the estimate of Rakovsky, writing in 1930 from his exile in Siberia: “Under our eyes has formed and is being formed a great class of directors which has its internal subdivisions and which increases through calculated co-option and direct or indirect nominations. . . . The element which unites this original class is a form, also original, of private property, to wit, the State power” (quoted from Souvarine, op. cit., p. 564). This analysis is indeed quite accurate for the development of the pre-Stalinist era. For the development of the relationship between party and Soviets, which is of decisive importance for the course of the October revolution, see I. Deutscher, The Prophet Armed: Trotsky 1879–1921, 1954.

28 In 1927, 90 per cent of the village Soviets and 75 per cent of their chairmen were non-party members; the executive committees of the counties were made up of 50 per cent party members and 50 per cent non-party members, while in the Central Committee 75 per cent of the delegates were party members. See the article on “Bolshevism” by Maurice Dobb in the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences.

How the party members of the Soviets, by voting “in conformity with the instructions they received from the permanent officials of the Party,” destroyed the Soviet system from within is described in detail in A. Rosenberg, A History of Bolshevism, London, 1934, chapter vi.

29 These figures are taken from Victor Kravchenko’s book I Chose Freedom: The Personal and Political Life of a Soviet Official, New York, 1946, pp. 278 and 303. This is of course a highly questionable source. But since in the case of Soviet Russia we basically have nothing but questionable sources to resort to—meaning that we have to rely altogether on news stories, reports and evaluations of one kind or another—all we can do is use whatever information at least appears to have a high degree of probability. Some historians seem to think that the opposite method—namely, to use exclusively whatever material is furnished by the Russian government—is more reliable, but this is the not the case. It is precisely the official material that is nothing but propaganda.

30 Stalin’s Report to the Sixteenth Congress denounced the deviations as the “reflection” of the resistance of the peasant and petty bourgeois classes in the ranks of the Party. (See Leninism, 1933, Vol. II, chapter iii.) Against this attack the opposition was curiously defenseless because they too, and especially Trotsky, were “always anxious to discover a struggle of classes behind the struggles of cliques” (Souvarine, op. cit., p. 440).

33 The watchword of the SS as formulated by Himmler himself begins with the words: “There is no task that exists for its own sake.” See Gunter d’Alquen, “Die SS,” in Schriften der Hochschule für Politik, 1939. The pamphlets issued by the SS solely for internal consumption emphasize time and again “the absolute necessity for understanding the futility of everything that is an end in itself” (see Der Reichsführer SS und Chef der deutschen Polizei, undated, “only for internal use within the police”).

35 Hitler stated in Mein Kampf (2 vols., 1st German ed., 1925 and 1927 respectively. Unexpurgated translation, New York, 1939) that it was better to have an antiquated program than to allow a discussion of program (Book II, chapter v). Soon he was to proclaim publicly: “Once we take over the government, the program will come of itself. . . . The first thing must be an inconceivable wave of propaganda. That is a political action which would have little to do with the other problems of the moment.” See Heiden, op. cit., p. 203.

36 Souvarine, in our opinion wrongly, suggests that Lenin had already abolished the role of a party program: “Nothing could show more clearly the non-existence of Bolshevism as a doctrine except in Lenin’s brain; every Bolshevik left to himself wandered from ‘the line’ of his faction . . . for these men were bound together by their temperament and by the ascendancy of Lenin rather than by ideas” (op. cit., p. 85).

38 The impact of the watchword, formulated by Himmler himself, is difficult to render. Its German equivalent: “Meine Ehre lieisst Treue,” indicates an absolute devotion and obedience which transcends the meaning of mere discipline or personal faithfulness. Nazi Conspiracy, whose translations of German documents and Nazi literature are indispensable source material but, unfortunately, are very uneven, renders the SS watchword: “My honor signifies faithfulness” (V, 346).

39 Mussolini was probably the first party leader who consciously rejected a formal program and replaced it with inspired leadership and action alone. Behind this act lay the notion that the actuality of the moment itself was the chief element of inspiration, which would only be hampered by a party program. The philosophy of Italian Fascism has been expressed by Gentile’s “actualism” rather than by Sorel’s “myths.” Compare also the article “Fascism” in the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. The Program of 1921 was formulated when the movement had been in existence two years and contained, for the most part, its nationalist philosophy.

47 This started with a feeling of complete alienation from normal life. Wrote Rudolf Binding, for instance: “More and more we are to be counted among the dead, among the estranged—because the greatness of the occurrence estranges and separates us—rather than among the banished whose return is possible” (ibid., p. 160). A curious reminiscence of the front generation’s elite claim can still be found in Himmler’s account of how he finally hit upon his “form of selection” for the reorganization of the SS: “. . . the most severe selection procedure is brought about by war, the struggle for life and death. In this procedure the value of blood is shown through achievement. . . . War, however, is an exceptional circumstance, and a way had to be found to make selections in peace time” (op. cit.).

50 Heiden, op. cit., shows how consistently Hitler sided with catastrophe in the early days of the movement, how he feared a possible recovery of Germany. “Half a dozen times [i.e., during the Ruhrputsch], in different terms, he declared to his storm troops that Germany was going under. ‘Our job is to insure the success of our movement’” (p. 167)—a success which at that moment depended upon the collapse of the fight in the Ruhr.

59 The following passage by Röhm is typical of the feeling of almost the whole younger generation and not only of an elite: “Hypocrisy and Pharisaism rule. They are the most conspicuous characteristics of society today. . . .

The homosexuality of these circles was also at least partially an expression of their protest against society.

60 The role of the Weltanschauung in the formation of the Nazi movement has been stressed many times by Hitler himself.

62 There is, for instance, the curious intervention of Welhelm Kube, General Commissar in Minsk and one of the oldest members of the Party, who in 1941, i.e., at the beginning of the mass murder, wrote to his chief: “I certainly am tough and willing to co-operate in the solution of the Jewish question, but people who have been brought up in our own culture are, after all, different from the local bestial hordes. Are we to assign the task of slaughtering them to the Lithuanians and Letts who are discriminated against even by the indigenous population? I could not do it. I ask you to give me clear-cut instructions to take care of the matter in the most humane way for the sake of the prestige of our Reich and our Party.” This letter is published in Max Weinreich, Hitler’s Professors, New York, 1946, pp. 153–154. Kube’s intervention was quickly overruled, yet an almost identical attempt to save the lives of Danish Jews, made by W. Best, the Reich’s plenipotentiary in Denmark, and a well-known Nazi, was more successful. See Nazi Conspiracy, V, 2.

Similarly Alfred Rosenberg, who had preached the inferiority of the Slav peoples, obviously never realized that his theories might one day mean their liquidation. Charged with the administration of the Ukraine, he wrote outraged reports about conditions there during the fall of 1942 after he had tried earlier to get direct intervention from Hitler himself. See Nazi Conspiracy, III, 83 ff., and IV, 62.

There are of course some exceptions to this rule. The man who saved Paris from destruction was General von Choltitz who, however, still “feared that he would be deprived of his command as he had not executed his orders” even though he knew that the “war had been lost for several years.” That he would have had the courage to resist the order “to turn Paris into a mass of ruins” without the energetic support of a Nazi of old standing, Otto Abetz the Ambassador to France, appears dubious according to his own testimony during the trial of Abetz in Paris. See New York Times, July 21, 1949.

63 An Englishman, Stephen H. Roberts, The House that Hitler Built, London, 1939, describes Himmler as “a man of exquisite courtesy and still interested in the simple things of life. He has none of the pose of those Nazis who act as demigods. . . . No man looks less like his job than this police dictator of Germany, and I am convinced that nobody I met in Germany is more normal. . . .” (pp. 89–90)—This reminds one in a curious way of the remark of Stalin’s mother who according to Bolshevik propaganda said of him: “An exemplary son. I wish everybody were like him” (Souvarine, op. cit., p. 656).

65 Bolshevik policy, in this respect surprisingly consistent, is well known and hardly needs further comment. Picasso, to take the most famous instance, is not liked in Russia even though he has become a Communist. It is possible that André Gide’s sudden reversal of attitude after seeing the Bolshevik reality in Soviet Russia (Retour de l’URSS) in 1936, definitely convinced Stalin of the uselessness of creative artists even as fellow-travelers. Nazi policy was distinguished from Bolshevik measures only insofar as it did not yet kill its first-rate talents.

It would be worthwhile to study in detail the careers of those comparatively few German scholars who went beyond mere co-operation and volunteered their services because they were convinced Nazis. (Weinreich, op. cit., the only available study, and misleading because he does not distinguish between professors who adopted the Nazi creed and those who owed their careers exclusively to the regime, omits the earlier careers of the concerned scholars and thus indiscriminately puts well-known men of great achievement into the same category as crackpots.) Most interesting is the example of the jurist Carl Schmitt, whose very ingenious theories about the end of democracy and legal government still make arresting reading; as early as the middle thirties, he was replaced by the Nazis’ own brand of political and legal theorists, such as Hans Frank, the later governor of Poland, Gottfried Neesse, and Reinhard Hoehn. The last to fall into disgrace was the historian Walter Frank, who had been a convinced antisemite and member of the Nazi party before it came to power, and who, in 1933, became director of the newly founded Reichsinstitut für Geschichte des Neuen Deutschlands with its famous Forschungsabteilung Judenfrage, and editor of the nine-volume Forschungen zur Judenfrage (1937–1944). In the early forties, Frank had to cede his position and influence to the notorious Alfred Rosenberg, whose Der Mythos des 20. Jahrhunderts certainly shows no aspiration whatsoever to “scholarship.” Frank clearly was mistrusted for no other reason than that he was not a charlatan.

What neither the elite nor the mob that “embraced” National Socialism with such fervor could understand was that “one cannot embrace this Order . . . by accident. Above and beyond the willingness to serve stands the unrelenting necessity of selection that knows neither extenuating circumstances nor clemency” (Der Weg der SS, issued by the SS Hauptamt-Schulungsamt, n.d., p. 4). In other words, concerning the selection of those who would belong to them the Nazis intended to make their own decisions, regardless of the “accident” of any opinions. The same appears to be true for the selection of Bolshevists for the secret police. F. Beck and W. Godin report in Russian Purge and the Extraction of Confession, 1951, p. 160, that the members of the NKVD are claimed from the ranks of party members without having the slightest opportunity to volunteer for this “career.”

1 See, for instance, E. Kohn-Bramstedt, Dictatorship and Political Police: The Technique of Control by Fear, London, 1945, p. 164 ff. The explanation is that “terror without propaganda would lose most of its psychological effect, whereas propaganda without terror does not contain its full punch” (p. 175). What is overlooked in these and similar statements, which mostly go around in circles, is the fact that not only political propaganda but the whole of modern mass publicity contains an element of threat; that terror, on the other hand, can be fully effective without propaganda, so long as it is only a question of conventional political terror of tyranny. Only when terror is intended to coerce not merely from without but, as it were, from within, when the political regime wants more than power, is terror in need of propaganda. In this sense the Nazi theorist, Eugen Hadamovsky, could say in Propaganda and nationale Macht, 1933: “Propaganda and violence are never contradictions. Use of violence can be part of the propaganda” (p. 22).

3 The so-called “Operation Hay” began with a decree dated February 16, 1942, by Himmler “concerning [individuals] of German stock in Poland,” stipulating that their children should be sent to families “that are willing [to accept them] without reservations, out of love for the good blood in them” (Nuremberg Document R 135, photo-stated by the Centre de Documentation Juive, Paris). It seems that in June, 1944, the Ninth Army actually kidnapped 40,000 to 50,000 children and subsequently transported them to Germany. A report on this matter, sent to the General Staff of the Wehrmacht in Berlin by a man called Brandenburg, mentions similar plans for the Ukraine (Document PS 031, published by Léon Poliakov in Bréviaire de la Haine, p. 317). Himmler himself made several references to this plan. (See Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, Office of the United States Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality, U.S. Government, Washington, 1946, III, 640, which contains excerpts from Himmler’s speech at Cracow in March, 1942; see also the comments on Himmler’s speech at Bad Schachen in 1943 in Kohn-Bramstedt, op. cit., p. 244.) How the selection of these children was arrived at can be gathered from medical certificates made out by Medical Section II at Minsk on August 10, 1942: “The racial examination of Natalie Harpf, born August 14, 1922, showed a normally developed girl of predominantly East Baltic type with Nordic fèatures.”—“Examination of Arnold Cornies, born February 19, 1930, showed a normally developed boy, twelve years old, of predominantly Eastern type with Nordic features.” Signed: N. Wc. (Document in the archives of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, New York, No. Occ E 3a-17.)

4 See Hitlers Tischgespräche. In the summer of 1942, he still talks about “[kicking] even the last Jew out of Europe” (p. 113) and resettling the Jews in Siberia or Africa (p. 311), or Madagascar, while in reality he had already decided on the “final solution” prior to the Russian invasion, probably in 1940, and ordered the gas ovens to be set up in the fall of 1941 (see Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression, II, pp. 265 ff.; III, pp. 783 ff. Document PS 1104; V. pp. 322 ff. Document PS 2605). Himmler already knew in the spring of 1941 that “the Jews [must be] exterminated to the last man by the end of the war. This is the unequivocal desire and command of the Fuehrer” (Dossier Kersten in the Centre de Documentation Juive).

5 In this connection there is a very interesting report, dated July 16, 1940, on a discussion at the Fuehrer’s headquarters, in the presence of Rosenberg, Lammers and Keitel, which Hitler began by stating the following “basic principles”: “It was now essential not to parade our ultimate goal before the entire world; . . . Hence it must not be obvious that [the decrees for maintaining peace and order in the occupied territories] point to a final settlement. All necessary measures—executions, resettlements—can, and will be, carried out in spite of this.” This is followed by a discussion which makes no reference whatever to Hitler’s words and in which Hitler no longer participates. He quite obviously had not been “understood” (Document L 221 in the Centre de Documentation Juive).

6 For Stalin’s confidence that Hitler would not attack Russia, see Isaac Deutscher, Stalin: a Political Biography, New York and London, 1949, pp. 454 ff., and especially the footnote on p. 458: “It was only in 1948 that the Chief of the State Planning Commission, Vice-Premier N. Voznesensky, disclosed that the economic plans for the third quarter of 1941 had been based on the assumption of peace and that a new plan, suited for war, had been drafted only after the outbreak of hostilities.” Deutscher’s estimate has now been solidly confirmed by Khrushchev’s report on Stalin’s reaction to the German attack on the Soviet Union. See his “Speech on Stalin” at the Twentieth Congress as released by the State Department, New York Times, June 5, 1956.

8 Eugen Hadamovsky, op. cit., is outstanding in the literature on totalitarian propaganda.

10 See Martin Bormann’s important memorandum on the “Relationship of National Socialism and Christianity” in Nazi Conspiracy, VI, 1036 ff. Similar formulations can be found time and again in the pamphlet literature issued by the SS for the “ideological indoctrination” of its cadets. “The laws of nature are subject to an unchangeable will that cannot be influenced. Hence it is necessary to recognize these laws” (“SS-Mann und Blutsfrage,” Schriftenreihe für die weltanscluudiche Schulung der Ordnungspolizei, 1942). All these are nothing but variations of certain phrases taken from Hitler’s Mein Kampf, of which the following is quoted as the motto for the pamphlet just mentioned: “While man attempts to struggle against the iron logic of nature, he comes into conflict with the basic principles to which alone he owes his very existence as man.”

17 The testimony of Karl Brandt, one of the physicians charged by Hitler with carrying out the program of euthanasia, is characteristic in this context (Medical Trial. US against Karl Brandt et al. Hearing of May 14, 1947). Brandt vehemently protested against the suspicion that the project was initiated to eliminate superfluous food consumers; he emphasized that party members who brought up such arguments in the discussion had always been sharply rebuked. In his opinion, the measures were dictated solely by “ethical considerations.” The same is, of course, true for the deportations. The files are filled with desperate memoranda written by the military complaining that the deportations of millions of Jews and Poles completely disregarded all “military and economic necessities.” See Poliakov, op. cit., p. 321, as well as the documentary material published there.

20 Hitler based the superiority of ideological movements over political parties on the fact that ideologies (Weltanschauungen) always “proclaim their infallibility” (Mein Kampf, Book II, chapter v, “Weltanschauung and Organization”).—The first pages of the official handbook for the Hitler Youth, The Nazi Primer, New York, 1938, consequently emphasize that all questions of Weltanschauung, formerly deemed “unrealistic” and “ununderstandable,” “have become so clear, simple and definite [my italics] that every comrade can understand them and co-operate in their solution.”

21 The first among the “pledges of the Party member,” as enumerated in the Organisationsbuch der NSDAP, reads: “The Führer is always right.” Edition published in 1936, p. 8. But the Dienstvorschrift für die P.O. der NSDAP, 1932, p. 38, puts it this way: “Hitler’s decision is final!” Note the remarkable difference in phraseology.

“Their claim to be infallible, [that] neither of them has ever sincerely admitted an error” is in this respect the decisive difference between Stalin and Trotsky on one hand, and Lenin on the other. See Boris Souvarine, Stalin: A Critical Survey of Bolshevism, New York, 1939, p. 583.

22 That Hegelian dialectics should provide a wonderful instrument for always being right, because they permit the interpretation of all defeats as the beginning of victory, is obvious. One of the most beautiful examples of this kind of sophistry occurred after 1933 when the German Communists for nearly two years refused to recognize that Hitler’s victory had been a defeat for the German Communist Party.

27 Konrad Heiden, Der Fuehrer: Hitler’s Rise to Power, Boston, 1944, underlines Hitler’s “phenomenal untruthfulness,” “the lack of demonstrable reality in nearly all his utterances,” his “indifference to facts which he does not regard as vitally important” (pp. 368, 374).—In almost identical terms, Khrushchev describes “Stalin’s reluctance to consider life’s realities” and his indifference to “the real state of affairs,” op. cit. Stalin’s opinion of the importance of facts is best expressed in his periodic revisions of Russian history.

29 It is interesting to note that the Bolsheviks during the Stalin era somehow accumulated conspiracies, that the discovery of a new one did not mean they would discard the former. The Trotskyite conspiracy started around 1930, the 300 families were added during the Popular Front period, from 1935 onward, British imperialism became an actual conspiracy during the Stalin-Hitler alliance, the “American Secret Service” followed soon after the close of the war; the last, Jewish cosmopolitanism, had an obvious and disquieting resemblance to Nazi propaganda.

32 Hitler used this picture for the first time in 1922: “Moses Kohn on the one side encourages his association to refuse the workers’ demands, while his brother Isaac in the factory invites the masses . . .” to strike. (Hitler’s Speeches: 1922–1939, ed. Baynes, London, 1942, p. 29.) It is noteworthy that no complete collection of Hitler’s speeches was ever published in Nazi Germany, so that one is forced to resort to the English edition. That this was no accident can be seen from a bibliography compiled by Philipp Bouhler, Die Reden des Führer’s nach der Machtübernahme, 1940: only the public speeches were printed verbatim in the Völkischer Beobachter; as for speeches to the Fuehrerkorps and other party units, they were merely “referred to” in that newspaper. They were not at any time meant for publication.

33 Feder’s 25 points contain only standard measures demanded by all antisemitic groups: expulsion of naturalized Jews, and treatment of native Jews as aliens. Nazi antisemitic oratory was always much more radical than its program.

Waldemar Gurian, “Antisemitism in Modern Germany,” in Essays on Antisemitism, ed. by Koppel S. Pinson, New York, 1946, p. 243, stresses the lack of originality in Nazi antisemitism: “All these demands and views were not remarkable for their originality—they were self-evident in all nationalistic circles; what was remarkable was the demagogic and oratorical skill with which they were presented.”

34 A typical example of mere nationalistic antisemitism within the Nazi movement itself is Röhm who writes: “And here again, my opinion differs from that of the national philistine. Not: the Jew is to be blamed for everything! We are to be blamed for the fact that the Jew can rule today” (Ernst Röhm, Die Geschichte eines Hochverräters, 1933, Volksausgabe, p. 284).

35 SS applicants had to trace their ancestry back to 1750. Applicants for leading positions in the party were asked only three questions: I. What have you done for the party? 2. Are you absolutely sound, physically, mentally, morally? 3. Is your family tree in order? See Nazi Primer.

It is characteristic for the affinity between the two systems that the elite and police formations of the Bolsheviks—the NKVD—also demanded proof of ancestry from their members. See F. Beck and W. Godin, Russian Purge and the Extraction of Confession, 1951.

39 In the isolated instances in which Hitler concerned himself with this question at all, he used to emphasize: “Incidentally, I am not the head of a state in the sense of a dictator or monarch, but I am a leader of the German people” (see Altsgewählte Reden des Führers, 1939, p. 114).—Hans Frank expresses himself in the same spirit: “The National Socialist Reich is not a dictatorial, let alone an arbitrary, regime. Rather, the National Socialist Reich rests on the mutual loyalty of the Führer and the people” (in Recht und Verwaltung, Munich, 1939, p. 15).

40 Hitler repeated many times: “The state is only the means to an end. The end is: Conservation of race” (Reden, 1939, p. 125). He also stressed that his movement “does not rest on the state idea, but is primarily based on the closed (Volksgemeinschaft” (see Reden, 1933, p. 125, and the speech before the new generation of political leaders [Führernachwuchs], 1937, which is printed as an addendum in Hitlers Tischgespräche, p. 446). This, mutatis mutandis, is also the core of the complicated double talk which is Stalin’s so-called “state theory”: “We are in favor of the State dying out, and at the same time we stand for the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat which represents the most powerful and mighty authority of all forms of State which have existed up to the present day. The highest possible development of the power of the State with the object of preparing the conditions for the dying out of the State; that is the Marxist formula” (op. cit., loc. cit.).

41 Alexander Stein, Adolf Hitler, Schüler der “Weisen von Zion,” Karlsbad, 1936, was the first to analyze by philological comparison the ideological identity of the teachings of the Nazis with that of the “Elders of Zion.” See also R. M. Blank, Adolf Hitler et les “Protocoles des Sages de Sion,” 1938.

The first to admit indebtedness to the teachings of the Protocols was Theodor Fritsch, the “grand old man” of German postwar antisemitism. He writes in the epilogue to his edition of the Protocols, 1924: “Our future statesmen and diplomats will have to learn from the oriental masters of villainy even the ABC of government, and for this purpose, the ‘Zionist Protocols’ offer an excellent preparatory schooling.”

[back]



* * *



42 On the history of the Protocols, see John S. Curtiss, An Appraisal of the Protocols of Zion, 1942.

The fact that the Protocols were a forgery was irrelevant for propaganda purposes. The Russian publicist S. A. Nilus who published the second Russian edition in 1905 was already well aware of the doubtful character of this “document” and added the obvious: “But if it were possible to show its authenticity by documents or by the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, if it were possible to disclose the persons standing at the head of the world-wide plot . . . then . . . ‘the secret iniquity’ could be broken. . . .” Translation in Curtiss, op. cit.

Hitler did not need Nilus to use the same trick: the best proof of their authenticity is that they have been proved to be a forgery. And he also adds the argument of their “plausibility”: “What many Jews may do unconsciously is here consciously made clear. And that is what counts” (Mein Kampf, Book I, chapter xi).

This is a real campaign against the established order” (p. 32).

46 This whole literature is well represented by the Chevalier de Malet, Recherches politiques et historiques qui prouvent l’existence d’une secte révolutionnaire, 1817, who quotes extensively from earlier authors. The heroes of the French Revolution are to him “mannequins” of an “agence secrète,” the agents of the Freemasons. But Freemasonry is only the name which his contemporaries have given to a “revolutionary sect” which has existed at all times and whose policy always has been to attack “remaining behind the scenes, manipulating the strings of the marionettes it thought convenient to put on the scene.” He starts by saying: “Probably, it will be difficult to believe in a plan which was formed in antiquity and always followed with the same constancy: . . . the authors of the Revolution are no more French than they are German, Italian, English, etc. They constitute a peculiar nation which was born and has grown in darkness, in the midst of all civilized nations, with the aim of subduing them all to its domination.”

For an extensive discussion of this literature, see E. Lesueur, La Franc-Maçonnerie Artésienne au 18e siècle, Bibliothèque d’Histoire Révolutionnaire, 1914. How persistent these conspiracy legends are in themselves, even under normal circumstances, can be seen by the enormous anti-Freemason crackpot literature in France, which is hardly less extensive than its antisemitic counterpart. A kind of compendium of all theories which saw in the French Revolution the product of secret conspiracy societies can be found in G. Bord, La Franc-Maçonnerie en France dès origines à 1815, 1908.

51 Hitler’s early promise (Reilen), “I shall never recognize that other nations have the same right as the German,” became official doctrine: “The foundation of the national socialist outlook in life is the perception of the unlikeness of men” (Nazi Primer, p. 5).

52 For instance, Hitler in 1923: “The German people consists for one third of heroes, for another third, of cowards, while the rest are traitors” (Hitler’s Speeches, ed. Baynes, p. 76).

After the seizure of power this trend became more brutally outspoken. See, for instance, Goebbels in 1934: “Who are the people to criticize? Party members? No. The rest of the German people? They should consider themselves lucky to be still alive. It would be too much of a good thing altogether, if those who live at our mercy should be allowed to criticize.” Quoted from Kohn-Bramstedt, op. cit., pp. 178–179.—During the war Hitler declared: “I am nothing but a magnet constantly moving across the German nation and extracting the steel from this people. And I have often stated that the time will come when all worth-while men in Germany are going to be in my camp. And those who will not be in my camp are worthless anyway.” Even then it was clear to Hitler’s immediate environment what would happen to those who “are worthless anyway” (see Der grossdeutsche Freiheitskampf. Reden Hitlers vom J. 9. 1939— 10. 3. 1940, p. 174).—Himmler meant the same when he said: “The Führer does not think in German, but in Germanic terms” (Dossier Kersten, cf. above), except that we know from Hitlers Tischgespräche (p. 315 ff.) that in those days he was already making fun even of the Germanic “clamor” and thought in “Aryan terms.”

57 It would be a serious error to interpret totalitarian leaders in terms of Max Weber’s category of the “charismatic leadership.” See Hans Gerth, “The Nazi Party,” in American Journal of Sociology, 1940, Vol. XLV. (A similar misunderstanding is also the shortcoming of Heiden’s biography, op. cit.) Gerth describes Hitler as the charismatic leader of a bureaucratic party. This alone, in his opinion, can account for the fact that “however flagrantly actions may have contradicted words, nothing could disrupt the firmly disciplinary organization.” (This contradiction, by the way, is much more characteristic of Stalin who “took care always to say the opposite of what he did, and to do the opposite of what he said.” Souvarine, op. cit., p. 431.)

For the source of this misunderstanding see Alfred von Martin, “Zur Soziologie der Gegenwart,” in Zeitschrift für Kulturgeschichte, Band 27, and Arnold Koettgen, “Die Gesetzmässigkeit der Verwaltung im Führerstaat,” in Reichsverwaltungsblatt, 1936, both of whom characterize the Nazi state as a bureaucracy with charismatic leadership.

64 Heiden, op. cit., p. 292, reports the following difference between the first and the following editions of Mein Kampf: The first edition proposes the election of party officials who only after their election are vested with “unlimited power and authority”; all following editions establish appointment of party officials from above by the next higher leader. Naturally, for the stability of totalitarian regimes the appointment from above is a much more important principle than the “unlimited authority” of the appointed official. In practice, the subleaders’ authority was decisively limited through the Leader’s absolute sovereignty. See below.

Stalin, coming from the conspiratory apparatus of the Bolshevik party, probably never thought this a problem. To him, appointments in the party machine were a question of accumulation of personal power. (Yet, it was only in the thirties, after he had studied Hitler’s example, that he let himself be addressed as “leader.”) It must be admitted, however, that he could easily justify these methods by quoting Lenin’s theory that “the history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade-union consciousness,” and that its leadership therefore necessarily comes from without. (See What is to be done?, first published in 1902, in Collected Works, Vol. IV, Book II.) The point is that Lenin considered the Communist Party as the “most progressive” part of the working class and at the same time “the lever of political organization” which “directs the whole mass of the proletariat,” i.e., an organization outside and above the class. (See W. H. Chamberlin, The Russian Revolution, ¡917–1921, New York, 1935, II, 361.) Nevertheless, Lenin did not question the validity of inner-party democracy, though he was inclined to restrict democracy to the working class itself.

70 The most important source for the organization and history of the SS is Himmler’s “Wesen und Aufgabe der SS und der Polizei,” in Sainmelliefle ausgewahlter Vortrage und Reden, 1939. In the course of the war, when the ranks of the Waffen-SS had to be filled with enlistments owing to losses at the front, the Waffen-SS lost its elite character within the SS to such an extent that now the General SS, i.e., the higher Fuehrer Corps, once again represented the real nuclear elite of the movement.

Very revealing documentary material for this last phase of the SS can be found in the archives of the Hoover Library, Himmler File, Folder 278. It shows that the SS went about its recruiting both among foreign workers and the native population by deliberately imitating the methods and rules of the French Foreign Legion. Enlistment among the Germans was based on an order by Hitler (never published) dated December, 1942, according to which “the 1925 class [should] be drafted into the Waffen-SS” (Himmler in a letter to Bormann). Conscription and enlistment were handled ostensibly on a voluntary basis. Precisely what this amounted to can be seen from numerous reports of SS leaders entrusted with this assignment. A report dated July 21, 1943, describes how the police surround the hall in which French workers are to be enlisted, how the French first sing the Marseillaise and then try to jump out of the windows. Attempts among German youth were scarcely more encouraging. Although they were put under extraordinary pressure and told that “they certainly would not want to join the ‘dirty gray hordes’” of the army, only 18 out of 220 members of the Hitler youth reported for duty (according to a report of April 30, 1943, submitted by Häussler, head of Conscription Center Southwest of the Waffen-SS); all others preferred to join the Wehrmacht. It is possible that the greater losses of the SS, as compared with those of the Wehrmacht, entered into their decisions (See Karl O. Paetel, “Die SS,” in Vierteljahreshefte für Zeitgeschichte, January, 1954). But that this factor alone could not have been decisive is proved by the following: As early as January, 1940, Hitler had ordered the drafting of SA-men into the Waffen-SS, and the results for Koenigsberg, based on a report that has been preserved, were listed as follows: 1807 SA-men were called up “for police service”; of these, 1094 failed to report; 631 were found to be unfit; 82 were fit for service in the SS.

72 This, however, was not the fault of Hitler, who always insisted that the very name of the SA (Sturmabteilung) indicated that it was only “a section of the movement” just like other party formations such as the propaganda department, the newspaper, the scientific institutes, etc. He also tried to dispel the illusions of the possible military value of a paramilitary formation and wanted training to be carried through according to the needs of the party and not according to the principles of an army.

76 Röhm’s autobiography shows clearly how little his political convictions agreed with those of the Nazis. He always desired a “Sohtatenstuat” and always insisted on the “Primat des Soldaten vor dem Politiker” (op. cit., p. 349). Especially telling for his nontotalitarian attitude, or rather for his inability even to understand totalitarianism and its “total” claim, is the following passage: “I don’t see why the following three things should not be compatible: my loyalty to the hereditary prince of the house of Wittelsbach and heir to Bavaria’s crown; my admiration for the quartermaster-general of the World War [i.e., Ludendorff], who today embodies the conscience of the German people; and my comradeship with the harbinger and bearer of the political struggle, Adolf Hitler” (p. 348). What ultimately cost Röhm his head was that after the seizure of power he envisioned a Fascist dictatorship patterned after the Italian regime, in which the Nazi party would “break the chains of the party” and “itself become the state,” which was exactly what Hitler meant to avoid under all circumstances. See Ernst Röhm, Warum SA?, speech before the diplomatic corps, December, 1933, Berlin, undated.

Within the Nazi party, the possibility of an SA-Reichswehr plot against the rule of the SS and the police apparently never was quite forgotten. Hans Frank, Governor General of Poland, in 1942, eight years after the murder of Röhm and General Schleicher, was suspected of wishing “after the war . . . to inaugurate the greatest fight for justice [against the SS] with the assistance of the Armed Forces and the SA” (Nazi Conspiracy, VI, 747).

80 The Death Head units of the SS were placed under the following rules: 1. No brigade is called for duty in its native district. 2. Every unit is to change after three weeks’ service. 3. Members are never to be sent into the streets alone or ever to display their Death Head insignia in public.

82 In his speeches to the SS Himmler always stressed committed crimes, underlining their gravity. About the liquidation of the Jews, for instance, he would say: “I also want to talk to you quite frankly on a very grave matter. Among ourselves it should be mentioned quite frankly, and yet we will never speak of it publicly.” On the liquidation of the Polish intelligentsia: “. . . you should hear this but also forget it immediately . . .” (Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 558 and 553, respectively).

Goebbels, op. cit., p. 266, notes in a similar vein: “On the Jewish question, especially, we have taken a position from which there is no escape. . . . Experience teaches that a movement and a people who have burned their bridges fight with much greater determination than those who are still able to retreat.”

83 Souvarine, op. cit., p. 648.—The way the totalitarian movements have kept the private lives of their leaders (Hitler and Stalin) absolutely secret contrasts with the publicity value which all democracies find in parading the private lives of Presidents, Kings, Prime Ministers, etc., in public. Totalitarian methods do not allow for an identification based on the conviction: Even the highest of us is only human.

Souvarine, op. cit., p. xiii, quotes the most frequently used tags to describe Stalin: “Stalin, the mysterious host of the Kremlin”; “Stalin, impenetrable personality”; “Stalin, the Communist Sphinx”; “Stalin, the Enigma,” the “insoluble mystery,” etc.

86 The circumstances surrounding Stalin’s death seem to contradict the infallibility of these methods. There is the possibility that Stalin, who, before he died, undoubtedly planned still another general purge, was killed by someone in his environment because no one felt safe any longer, but despite a great deal of circumstantial evidence this cannot be proved.

87 Thus Hitler personally cabled his responsibility for the Potempa murder to the SA assassins in 1932, although presumably he had nothing whatever to do with it. What mattered here was establishing a principle of identification, or, in the language of the Nazis, “the mutual loyalty of the Leader and the people” on which “the Reich rests” (Hans Frank, op. cil.).

88 “One of Stalin’s distinctive characteristics . . . is systematically to throw his own misdeeds and crimes, as well as his political errors . . . on the shoulders of those whose discredit and ruin he is plotting” (Souvarine, op. cit., p. 655). It is obvious that a totalitarian leader can choose freely whom he wants to impersonate his own errors since all acts committed by subleaders are supposed to be inspired by him, so that anybody can be forced into the role of an impostor.

89 That it was Hitler himself—and not Himmler, or Bormann, or Goebbels—who always initiated the actually “radical” measures: that they were always more radical than the proposals made by his immediate environment; that even Himmler was appalled when he was entrusted with the “final solution” of the Jewish question—all this has now been proved by innumerable documents. And the fairy tale that Stalin was more moderate than the leftist factions of the Bolshevist Party is no longer believed, either. It is all the more important to remember that totalitarian leaders invariably try to appear more moderate to the outside world and that their real role—namely, to drive the movement forward at any price and if anything to step up its speed—remains carefully concealed. See, for instance, Admiral Erich Reader’s memo on “My Relationship to Adolf Hitler and to the Party” in Nazi Conspiracy, VIII, 707 ff. “When information or rumours arose about radical measures of the Party and the Gestapo, one could come to the conclusion by the conduct of the Fuehrer that such measures were not ordered by the Fuehrer himself. . . . In the course of future years, I gradually came to the conclusion that the Fuehrer himself always leaned toward the more radical solution without letting on outwardly.”

In the intraparty struggle which preceded his rise to absolute power, Stalin was careful always to pose as “the man of the golden mean” (see Deutscher, op. cit., pp. 295 ff); though certainly no “man of compromise,” he never abandoned this role altogether. When, for instance, in 1936 a foreign journalist questioned him about the movement’s aim of world revolution, he replied: “We have never had such plans and intentions. . . . This is the product of a misunderstanding . . . a comic one, or rather a tragicomic one” (Deutscher, op. cit., p. 422).

His considerations actually led him to Koyré’s conclusion, i.e., to adopt the principles of secret societies without their secretiveness and to establish them in “broad daylight.” There was, in the prepower stage of the movement, hardly anything which the Nazis consistently kept secret. It was only during the war, when the Nazi regime became fully totalitarianized and the party leadership found itself surrounded from all sides by the military hierarchy on which it depended for the conduct of the war, that the elite formations were instructed in no uncertain terms to keep everything connected with “final solutions”—i.e., deportations and mass exterminations—absolutely secret. This was also the time when Hitler began to act like the chief of a band of conspirators, but not without personally announcing and circulating this fact explicitly. During a discussion with the General Staff in May, 1939, Hitler laid down the following rules, which sound as if they had been copied from a primer for a secret society: “1. No one who need not know must be informed. 2. No one must know any more than he needs to. 3. No one must know any earlier than he has to” (quoted from Heinz Holldack, Was wirklich geschah, 1949, p. 378).

Wolff under the title The Sociology of Georg Simmel, 1950.

92 ”Precisely because the lower grades of the society constitute a mediating transition to the actual center of the secret, they bring about the gradual compression of the sphere of repulsion around the same, which affords more secure protection than the abruptness of a radical standing wholly without or wholly within could secure” (ibid., p. 489).

93 The terms “sworn brothers,” “sworn comrades,” “sworn community,” etc., are repeated ad nauseam throughout Nazi literature, partly because of their appeal to juvenile romanticism which was widespread in the German youth movement. It was mainly Himmler who used these terms in a more definite sense, introduced them into the “central watchword” of the SS (“Thus we have fallen in line and march forward to a distant future following the unchangeable laws as a National Socialist order of Nordic men and as a sworn community of their tribes [Sippen],” see D’Alquen, op. cit.) and gave them their articulate meaning of “absolute hostility” against all others (see Simmel, op. cit., p. 489): “Then when the mass of humanity of 1 to 1½ milliards [sic!] lines up against us, the Germanic people, . . .” See Himmler’s speech at the meeting of the SS Major Generals at Posen, October 4, 1943, Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 558.

94 Simmel, op. cit., p. 490.—This, like so many other principles, was adopted by the Nazis after careful reflection on the implications of the “Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” Hitler said as early as 1922: “[The gentlemen of the Right] have never yet understood that it is not necessary to be an enemy of the Jew to drag you one day . . . to the scaffold . . . it is quite enough . . . not to be a Jew: that will secure the scaffold for you” (Hitler’s Speeches, p. 12). At that time, nobody could guess that this particular form of propaganda actually meant: One day, it will not be necessary to be an enemy of ours to be dragged to the scaffold; it will be quite enough to be a Jew, or, ultimately, a member of some other people, to be declared “racially unfit” by some Health Commission. Himmler believed and preached that the whole SS was based on the principle that “we must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to members of our own blood and nobody else” (op. cit., loc. cit.).

100 The Gestapo was set up by Göring in 1933; Himmler was appointed chief of the Gestapo in 1934 and began at once to replace its personnel with his SS-men; at the end of the war, 75 per cent of all Gestapo agents were SS-men. It must also be considered that the SS units were particularly qualified for this job as Himmler had organized them, even in the prepower stage, for espionage duty among party members (Heiden, op. cit., p. 308). For the history of the Gestapo, see Giles, op. cit., and also Nazi Conspiracy, Vol. II, chapter xii.

101 It was probably one of the decisive ideological errors of Rosenberg, who fell from the Fuehrer’s favor and lost his influence in the movement to men like Himmler, Bormann, and even Streicher, that his Myth of the Twentieth Century admits a racial pluralism from which only the Jews were excluded. He thereby violated the principle that whoever is not included (“the Germanic people”) is excluded (“the mass of humanity”). Of. note 87.

111 Himmler was well aware of the fact that it was one of his “most important and lasting accomplishments” to have transformed the racial question from “a negative concept based on matter-of-course antisemitism” into “an organizational task for building up the SS” (Der Reichsführer SS und Chef der deutschen Polizei, “exclusively for use within the police”; undated). Thus, “for the first time, the racial question had been placed into, or, better still, had become the focal point, going far beyond the negative concept underlying the natural hatred of Jews. The revolutionary idea of the Fuehrer had been infused with warm lifeblood” (Der Weg der SS. Der Reichsführer SS. SS-Hauptamt-Schulungsamt. Dust jacket: “Not for publication,” undated, p. 25).

112 As soon as he was appointed chief of the SS in 1929, Himmler introduced the principle of racial selection and marriage laws and added: “The SS knows very well that this order is of great significance. Taunts, sneers or misunderstanding don’t touch us; the future is ours.” Quoted from d’Alquen, op. cit. And again, fourteen years later, in his speech at Kharkov (Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 572 ff.), Himmler reminds his SS leaders that “we were the first really to solve the problem of blood by action . . . and by problem of blood, we of course do not mean antisemitism. Antisemitism is exactly the same as delousing. Getting rid of lice is not a question of ideology. It is a matter of cleanliness. . . . But for us the question of blood was a reminder of our own worth, a reminder of what is actually the basis holding this German people together.”

1 The Nazis fully realized that the seizure of power might lead to the establishment of absolutism. “National Socialism, however, has not spearheaded the struggle against liberalism in order to bog down in absolutism and start the game all over again” (Werner Best, Die deutsche Polizei, p. 20). The warning expressed here, as in countless other places, is directed against the state’s claim to be absolute.

2 Trotsky’s theory, first pronounced in 1905, did of course not differ from the revolutionary strategy of all Leninists in whose eyes “Russia herself was merely the first domain, the first rampart, of international revolution: her interests were to be subordinated to the supernational strategy of militant socialism. For the time being, however, the boundaries of both Russia and victorious socialism were the same” (Isaac Deutscher, Stalin. A Political Biography, New York and London, 1949, p. 243).

3 “The year 1934 is significant because of the new Party statute, announced at the Seventeenth Party Congress, which provided that “periodic . . . purges are to [be] carried out for the systematic cleansing of the Party.” (Quoted from A. Avtorkhanov, “Social Differentiation and Contradictions in the Party,” Bulletin of the Institute for the Study of the USSR, Munich, February, 1956.)—The party purges during the early years of the Russian Revolution have nothing in common with their later totalitarian perversion into an instrument of permanent instability. The first purges were conducted by local control commissions before an open forum to which party and non-party members had free access. They were planned as a democratic control organ against bureaucratic corruption in the party and “were to serve as a substitute for real elections” (Deutscher, op. cit., pp. 233-34).—An excellent short survey of the development of the purges can be found in Avtorkhanov’s recent article which also refutes the legend that the murder of Kirov gave rise to the new policy. The general purge had begun before Kirov’s death which was no more than a “convenient pretext to give it added drive.” In view of the many “inexplicable and mysterious” circumstances surrounding Kirov’s murder, one suspects that the “convenient pretext” was carefully planned and executed by Stalin himself. See Khrushchev’s “Speech on Stalin,” New York Times, June 5, 1956.

4 Deutscher, op. cit., p. 282, describes the first attack on Trotsky’s “permanent revolution” and Stalin’s counterformulation of “socialism in one country” as an accident of political maneuvering. In 1924, Stalin’s “immediate purpose was to descredit Trotsky. . . . Searching in Trotsky’s past, the triumvirs came across the theory of ‘permanent revolution,’ which he had formulated in 1905. . . . It was in the course of that polemic that Stalin arrived at his formula of ‘socialism in one country.’”

5 The liquidation of the Röhm faction in lune, 1934, was preceded by a short interval of stabilization. At the beginning of the year, Rudolf Diets, the chief of the political police in Berlin, could report that there were no more illegal (“revolutionary”) arrests by the SA and that older arrests of this kind were being investigated. (Nazi Conspiracy. U. S. Government. Washington, 1946, V, 205.) In April, 1934, Reichsminister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, an old member of the Nazi Party, issued a decree to place restrictions upon the exercise of “protective custody” (ibid., III, 555) in consideration of the “stabilization of the national situation.” (See Das Archiv, April, 1934, p. 31.) This decree, however, was never published (Nazi Conspiracy, VII, 1099; II, 259). The political police of Prussia had prepared a special report on the excesses of the SA for Hitler in the year 1933 and suggested the prosecution of the SA leaders named therein.

Hitler solved the situation by killing these SA leaders without legal proceedings and discharging all those police officers who had opposed the SA. (See the sworn affidavit of Rudolf Diels, ibid., V, 224.) In this manner he had safeguarded himself completely against all legalization and stabilization. Among the numerous jurists who enthusiastically served the “National Socialist idea” only very few comprehended what was really at stake. In this group belongs primarily Theodor Maunz, whose essay Gestalt and Recht der Polizei (Hamburg, 1943) is quoted with approval even by those authors, who, like Paul Werner, belonged to the higher Fuehrer Corps of the SS.

7 Heinrich Himmler, “Die Schutzstaffel,” in Grundlagen, Aufbau unit Wirtschajtsordnung des nationalsozialistischen Staates, Nr. 7b. This constant radicalization of the principle of racial selection can be found in all phases of Nazi policy. Thus, the first to be exterminated were the full Jews, to be followed by those who were half-Jewish and one-quarter Jewish; or first the insane, to be followed by the incurably sick and, eventually, by all families in which there were any “incurably sick.” The “selection which can never stand still” did not stop before the SS itself, either. A Fuehrer decree dated May 19, 1943, ordered that all men who were bound to foreigners by family ties, marriage or friendship were to be eliminated from state, party, Wehrmacht and economy; this affected 1,200 SS leaders (see Hoover Library Archives, Himmler File, Folder 330).

8 It is common knowledge that in Russia “the repression of socialists and anarchists had grown in severity in the same ratio as the country became pacified” (Anton Ciliga, The Russian Enigma, London, 1940, p. 244). Deutscher, op. cit., p. 218, thinks that the reason for the vanishing of the “libertarian spirit of the revolution” at the moment of victory could be found in a changed attitude of the peasants: they turned against Bolshevism “the more resolutely the more they became confident that the power of the landlords and the White generals had been broken.” This explanation seems rather weak in view of the dimensions which terror was to assume after 1930. It also fails to take into account that full terror did not break loose in the twenties but in the thirties, when the opposition of the peasant classes was no longer an active factor in the situation.—Khrushchev, too (op. cit.), notes that “extreme repressive measures were not used” against the opposition during the fight against the Trotskyites and the Bukharinites, but that “the repression against them began” much later after they had long been defeated.

Terror by the Nazi regime reached its peak during the war, when the German nation was actually “united.” Its preparation goes back to 1936 when all organized interior resistance had vanished and Himmler proposed an expansion of the concentration camps. Characteristic of this spirit of oppression regardless of resistance is Himmler’s speech at Kharkov before the SS leaders in 1943: “We have only one task, . . . to carry on the racial struggle without mercy. . . . We will never let that excellent weapon, the dread and terrible reputation which preceded us in the battles for Kharkov, fade, but will constantly add new meaning to it” (Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 572 ff.).

9 See Theodor Maunz, op. cit., pp. 5 and 49.—How little the Nazis thought of the laws and regulations they themselves had issued, and which were regularly published by W. Hoche under the title of Die Gesetzgebung des Kabinetts Hitler (Berlin, 1933 ff.), may be gathered from a random remark made by one of their constitutional jurists. He felt that in spite of the absence of a comprehensive new legal order there nevertheless had occurred a “comprehensive reform” (see Ernst R. Huber, “Die deutsche Polizei,” in Zeitschriftfür die gesamte Staatswissenschaft, Band 101, 1940/1, p. 273 ff.).

10 Maunz, op. cit., p. 49. To my knowledge, Maunz is the only one among Nazi authors who has mentioned this circumstance and sufficiently emphasized it. Only by going through the five volumes of Verfügungen, Anordnungen, Bekanntgaben, which were collected and printed during the war by the party chancellery on instructions of Martin Bormann, is it possible to obtain an insight into this secret legislation by which Germany in fact was governed. According to the preface, the volumes were “meant solely for internal party work and to be treated as confidential.” Four of these evidently very rare volumes, compared to which the Hoche collection of the legislation of Hitler’s cabinet is merely a façade, are in the Hoover Library.

13 See Deutscher, op. cit., p. 375.—Upon close reading of Stalin’s speech concerning the constitution (his report to the Extraordinary Eighth Soviet Congress of November 25, 1936) it becomes evident that it was never meant to be definitive. Stalin stated explicitly: “This is the framework of our constitution at the given historical moment. Thus the draft of the new constitution represents the sum total of the road already traveled, the sum total of achievements already existing.” In other words, the constitution was already dated the moment it was announced, and was merely of historical interest. That this is not just an arbitrary interpretation is proved by Molotov, who in his speech about the constitution picks up Stalin’s theme and underlines the provisional nature of the whole matter: “We have realized only the first, the lower phase, of Communism. Even this first phase of Communism, Socialism, is by no means completed; only its skeletal structure has been erected” (see Die Verjassung des Sozialistischen Staates der Arbeiter und Bauern, Editions Prométhée, Strasbourg, 1937, pp. 42 and 84).

17 Justice Robert H. Jackson, in his opening speech at the Nuremberg Trials, based his description of the political structure of Nazi Germany consistently on the co-existence of “two governments in Germany—the real and the ostensible. The forms of the German Republic were maintained for a time and it was the outward and visible government. But the real authority in the State was outside of and above the law and rested in the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party” (Nazi Conspiracy, I, 125). See also the distinction of Roberts, op. cit., p. 101, between the party and a shadow state: “Hitler obviously leans toward increasing the duplication of functions.”

Students of Nazi Germany seem agreed that the state had only ostensible authority. For the only exception, see Ernst Fraenkel, The Dual State, New York and London, 1941, who claims the co-existence of a “normative and a prerogative state” living in constant friction as “competitive and not complementary parts of the German Reich.” According to Fraenkel, the normative state was maintained by the Nazis for the protection of the capitalist order and private property and had full authority in all economic matters, while the prerogative state of the party ruled supreme in all political matters.

20 Characteristic is a memo of Minister of the Interior Frick, who resented the fact that Himmler, the leader of the SS, should have superior power. See Nazi Conspiracy, III, 547.—Noteworthy in this respect also are Rosenberg’s notes about a discussion with Hitler in 1942: Rosenberg had never before the war held a state position but belonged to the intimate circle around Hitler. Now that he had become Reichsminister for the Eastern Occupied Territories, he was constantly confronted with “direct actions” of other plenipotentiaries (chiefly SS-men) who overlooked him because he now belonged to the ostensible apparatus of the state. See ibid., IV, 65 ff. The same happened to Hans Frank, Governor General of Poland. There were only two cases in which the attainment of ministerial rank did not entail any loss of power and prestige: that of Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, and of Minister of the Interior Himmler. As regards Himmler, we possess a memorandum, presumably from the year 1935, which illustrates the systematic singlemindedness of the Nazis in regulating the relations between party and state. This memorandum, which apparently originated in Hitler’s immediate entourage and was found among the correspondence of the Reichsadjudantur of the Fuehrer and the Gestapo, contains a warning against making Himmler state secretary of the Ministry of the Interior because in that case he could “no longer be a political leader” and “would be alienated from the party.” Here, too, we find mention of the technical principle regulating the relations between party and state: “A Reichsleiter [a high party functionary] must not be subordinated to a Reichsminister [a high state functionary].” (The undated, unsigned memorandum, entitled Die geheime Staatspolizei, can be found in the archives of the Hoover Library, File P. Wiedemann.)

At present 57 per cent of them were Communists. The percentage of Communists in the management of co-operatives had risen from 5 to 50 per cent; and in the commanding staffs of the armed forces from 16 to 24. The same happened in all other institutions which Stalin described as the ‘transmission belts’ connecting the party with the people.”

That the term state police actually makes no allowance for this fact shall be mentioned here only in passing” (Grundfragen der deutschen Polizei, Report on the Constitutive Session of the Committee on Police Law of the Academy for German Law, October II, 1936.

29 For example, such an attempt to circumscribe the separate responsibilities and to counter the “anarchy of authority” was made by Hans Frank in Recht und Verwaltung, 1939, and again in an address titled Technik des Statues, in 1941. He expressed the opinion that “legal guarantees” were not the “prerogative of liberal systems of government” and that the administration should continue to be governed, as before, by the laws of the Reich, which now were inspired and guided by the program of the National Socialist party. It was precisely because he wanted to prevent such a new legal order at any price that Hitler never acknowledged the program of the Nazi party. Of party members who made such proposals he was wont to speak with contempt, describing them as “eternally tied to the past,” as persons “who are unable to leap across their own shadow” (Felix Kersten, Totenkopf und Treue, Hamburg).

31 Nuremberg Documents, PS 3063 in the Centre de Documentation Juive in Paris. The document is a report of the supreme party court about “events and party court proceedings connected with the antisemitic demonstrations of November 9, 1938.” On the basis of investigations by the police and the office of the Attorney General the supreme court came to the conclusion that “the verbal instructions of the Reichs-propagandaleiter must have been understood by all party leaders to mean that, to the outside, the party did not wish to appear as the instigator of the demonstration, but in reality was to organize and carry it through. . . . The re-examination of the command echelons has shown . . . that the active National Socialist molded in the prepower struggle [Kampfzeit] takes it for granted that actions in which the party does not wish to appear in the role of organizer are not ordered with unequivocal clarity and down to the last detail. Hence he is accustomed to understand that an order may mean more than its verbal content, just as it has more or less become routine with the order giver, in the interests of the party . . . not to say everything and only to intimate what he wants to achieve by the order. . . . Thus, the . . . orders—for instance, not the Jew Grünspan but all Jewry must be blamed for the death of Party Comrade vom Rath, . . . pistols should be brought along, . . . every SA-man now ought to know what he had to do—were understood by a number of subleaders to mean that Jewish blood would now have to be shed for the blood of Party Comrade vom Rath. . . .” Particularly significant is the end of the report, in which the supreme party court quite openly takes exception to these methods: “It is another question whether, in the interest of discipline, the order that is intentionally vague, and given in the expectation that its recipient will recognize the intent of the order giver and act accordingly, must not be relegated to the past.” Here, too, there were persons who, in Hitler’s words, “were unable to leap across their own shadow” and insisted upon legislative measures, because they did not understand that not the order but the will of the Fuehrer was the supreme law. Here, the difference between the mentality of the elite formations and the party agencies is particularly clear.

35 The SA obviously resented its loss of rank and power in the Nazi hierarchy and tried desperately to keep up appearances. In their magazines—Der SA-Mann, Das Archiv, etc.—many indications, veiled and unveiled, of this impotent rivalry with the SS can be found. More interesting is that Hitler still in 1936, when the SA had already lost its power, would assure them in a speech: “All that you are, you are through me; and all that I am, I am through you alone.” See Ernst Bayer, Die SA, Berlin, 1938.

36 Compare Rosenberg’s speech of June, 1941: “I believe that our political task will consist of . . . organizing these peoples in certain types of political bodies . . . and building them up against Moscow” with the “Undated Memorandum for the Administration in the Occupied Eastern Territories”: “With the dissolution of the USSR after her defeat, no body politic is left in the Eastern territories and therefore . . . no citizenship for their population” (Trial of the Major War Criminals, Nuremberg, 1947, XXVI, p. 616 and 604, respectively).

38 For the variety of overlapping party organizations, see Rang-und Organisationsliste der NSDAP, Stuttgart, 1947, and Nazi Conspiracy, I, 178, which distinguishes four main categories: 1. Gliederungen der NSDAP, which had existed before its rise to power; 2. Angeschlossene Verbände der NSDAP, which comprise those societies which had been co-ordinated; 3. Betreute Organisationen der NSDAP; and 4. Weitere nationalsozialistische Organisationen. In nearly every category, one finds a different students’, women’s, teachers’, and workers’ organization.

39 The gigantic organization for public works, headed by Todt and later led by Albert Speer, was created by Hitler outside of all party hierarchies and affiliations. This organization might have been used against the authority of party or even police organizations. It is noteworthy that Speer could risk pointing out to Hitler (during a conference in 1942) the impossibility of organizing production under Himmler’s regime, and even demand jurisdiction over slave labor and concentration camps. See Nazi Conspiracy, I, 916-917.

40 Such an innocuous and unimportant society, for instance, as the NSKK (the National Socialist corps of automobilists founded in 1930) was suddenly elevated, in 1933, to the status of an elite formation, sharing with the SA and the SS the privilege of an independent affiliated unit of the party. Nothing followed this rise in the ranks of the Nazi hierarchy; retrospectively, it looks like an idle threat to the SA and SS.

42 Ibid., p. 159 ff.—According to other reports, there are different examples of the staggering multiplication of the Soviet police apparatus, primarily the local and regional associations of the NKVD, which work independently of one another and which have their counterparts in the local and regional networks of party agents. It is in the nature of things that we know considerably less about Russian conditions than we do about those in Nazi Germany, especially as far as organizational details are concerned.

44 In the aforementioned address (see footnote 29) Hans Frank showed that at some point he wanted to stabilize the movement, and his numerous complaints as Governor General of Poland testify to a total lack of understanding of the deliberately anti-utilitarian tendencies of Nazi policy. He cannot understand why the subjected peoples are not exploited but exterminated. Rosenberg, in the eyes of Hitler, was racially unreliable because he meant to establish satellite states in the conquered Eastern territories and did not understand that Hitler’s population policy aimed at depopulating these territories.

45 The notion of a division into “little principalities” which formed “a pyramid of power outside the law with the Fuehrer at its apex” is Robert H. Jackson’s. See chapter xii of Nazi Conspiracy, 11, 1 ff. In order to avoid the establishment of such an authoritarian state, Hitler, as early as 1934, issued the following party decree: “The form of address ‘Mein Fuehrer’ is reserved for the Fuehrer alone. I herewith forbid all subleaders of the NSDAP to allow themselves to be addressed as ‘Mein Reichsleiter,’ etc., either in words or in writing. Rather, the form of address has to be Pg. [Party Comrade] . . . or Gauleiter, etc.” See Verfügungen, Anordnungen, Bekanntgaben, op. cit., decree of August 20, 1934.

49 The first step of Himmler in this direction occurred in the fall of 1944, when he ordered on his own initiative that the gas installations in the extermination camps be dismantled and the mass slaughter be stopped. This was his way of initiating peace negotiations with the Western powers. Interestingly enough. Hitler apparently was never informed of these preparations; it seems that no one dared tell him that one of his most important war aims had already been given up.

53 Franz Neumann, op. cit., pp. 521 ff., is doubtful “whether Germany can be called a State. It is far more a gang where the leaders are perpetually compelled to agree after disagreements.” Konrad Heiden’s works on Nazi Germany are representative for the theory of government by a clique.—As regards the formation of cliques around Hitler, The Bormann Letters, published by Trevor-Roper, are quite enlightening. In the trial of the doctors (the United States vs. Karl Brandt et at., hearing of May 13, 1947), Victor Brack testified that as early as 1933 Bormann, acting no doubt on Hitler’s orders, had begun to organize a group of persons who stood above state and party.

55 In a speech of November 23, 1939, quoted from Trial of Major War Criminals, Vol. 26, p. 332. That this pronouncement was more than a hysterical aberration dictated by chance is apparent from Himmler’s speech (the stenographic transcript can be found in the archives of the Hoover Library, Himmler File, Folder 332) at the conference of mayors at Posen in March, 1944. It says: “What values can we place onto the scales of history? The value of our own people. . . . The second, I would almost say, even greater value is the unique person of our Fuehrer Adolf Hitler, . . . who for the first time after two thousand years . . . was sent to the Germanic race as a great leader. . . .”

56 See Hitler’s statements on this question in Hitlers Tischgespräche, pp. 253 f. and 222 f.: The new Fuehrer would have to be elected by a “senate”; the guiding principle for the Fuehrer’s election must be that any discussion among the personalities participating in the election should cease for the duration of the proceedings. Within three hours Wehrmacht, party and all civil servants will have to be newly sworn in. “He had no illusions about the fact that in this election of the supreme head of the state there might not always be an outstanding Fuehrer personality at the helm of the Reich.” But this entailed no dangers, “so long as the over-all machinery functions properly.”

62 This is supported by the fact that the decree to murder all incurably sick was issued on the day the war broke out, but even more so by Hitler’s statements during the war, quoted by Goebbels (The Goebbels Diaries, ed. Louis P. Lochner, 1948) to the effect that “the war had made possible for us the solution of a whole series of problems that could never have been solved in normal times,” and that, no matter how the war turned out, “the Jews will certainly be the losers” (p. 314).

63 The Wehrmacht of course tried time and again to explain to the various party organs the dangers of a war conduct in which commands were issued with utter disregard for all military, civilian and economic necessities (see, for instance, Poliakov, op. cit., p. 321). But even many high Nazi functionaries had difficulty understanding this neglect of all objective economic and military factors in the situation. They had to be told time and again that “economic considerations should fundamentally remain unconsidered in the settlement of the [Jewish] problem” (Nazi Conspiracy, VI, 402), but still would complain that the interruption of a big building program in Poland “would not have happened if the many thousands of Jews working at it had not been deported. Now the order is given that the Jews will have to be removed from the armament projects. I hope that this . . . order will soon be cancelled, for then the situation will be still worse.” This hope of Hans Frank, Governor General of Poland, was as little fulfilled as his later expectations of a militarily more sensible policy toward Poles and Ukrainians. His complaints are interesting (see his Diary in Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 902 ff.) because he is frightened exclusively by the anti-utilitarian aspect of Nazi policies during the war. “Once we have won the war, then for all I care, mince-meat can be made of the Poles and the Ukrainians and all the others who run around here. . . .”

64 Originally, only special units of the SS—the Death Head formations—were employed in the concentration camps. Later replacements came from the Armed SS divisions. From 1944 on, units of the regular armed forces were also employed but usually incorporated in the Armed SS. (See the Affidavit of a former SS official of the concentration camp of Neuengamme in Nazi Conspiracy, VII, 211.) How the active presence of the Wehrmacht made itself felt in the concentration camps has been described in Odd Nansen’s concentration camp diary Day After Day, London, 1949. Unfortunately, it shows that these regular army troops were at least as brutal as the SS.

66 The Nazis were especially fond of reckoning in terms of millennia. Himmler’s pronouncements that SS-men were solely interested in “ideological questions whose importance counted in terms of decades and centuries” and that they “served a cause which in two thousand years occurred only once” are repeated, with slight variations, throughout the entire indoctrination material issued by the SS-Hauptamt-Schulungsamt (Wesen und Aufgabe der SS und der Polizei, p. 160).—As for the Bolshevik version, the best reference is the program of the Communist International as formulated by Stalin as early as 1928 at the Party Congress in Moscow. Particularly interesting is the evaluation of the Soviet Union as “the basis for the world movement, the center of international revolution, the greatest factor in world history. In the USSR, the world proletariat for the first time acquires a country . . .” (quoted from W. H. Chamberlin, Blueprint for World Conquest, 1946, where the programs of the Third International are reprinted verbatim).

68 See Heiden, op. cit., p. 722.—Hitler stated in a speech of November 23, 1937, before the future political leaders at the Ordensburg Sonthofen: Not “ridiculously small tribes, tiny countries, slates or dynasties . . . but only races [can] function as world conquerors. A race, however—at least in the conscious sense—we still have to become” (see Hitlers Tischgespräche, p. 445).—In complete harmony with this by no means accidental phrasing is a decree of August 9, 1941, in which Hitler prohibited the further use of the term “German race” because it would lead to the “sacrifice of the racial idea as such in favor of a mere nationality principle, and to the destruction of important conceptual preconditions of our whole racial and folk policy” (Verfügungen, Anordnungen, Bekanntgaben). It is obvious that the concept of a German race would have constituted an impediment to the progressive “selection” and extermination of undesirable parts among the German population which in those very years was being planned for the future.

69 Himmler consequently “very soon formed a Germanic SS in the various countries” whom he told: “We do not expect you to become German out of opportunism. But we do expect you to subordinate your national ideal to the greater racial and historical ideal, to the Germanic Reich” (Heiden, op. cit.). Its future task would be to form through “the most copious breeding” a “racial superstratum” which in another twenty to thirty years would “present the whole of Europe with its leading class” (Himmler’s speech at the meeting of the SS Major Generals at Posen in 1943, in Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 558 ff.).

Stalin appealed directly to the horror of risk and uncertainty that had taken possession of many Bolsheviks” (p. 291).

73 Hitler, therefore, speaking to members of the General Staff (Blomberg, Fritsch, Raeder) and high-ranking civilians (Neurath, Göring) in November, 1937, could permit himself to state openly that he needed depopulated space and reject the idea of conquering alien peoples. That this would automatically result in a policy of exterminating such peoples was evidently not realized by any one of his listeners.

74 This began with an order in July, 1934, by which the SS was elevated to the rank of an independent organization within the NSDAP, and completed by a top secret decree of August, 1938, which declared that the SS special formations, the Death Head Units and the Shock Troops (Verfügungstruppen) were neither part of the army nor of the police; the Death Head Units had “to clear up special tasks of police nature” and the Shock Troops were “a standing armed unit exclusively at my disposal” (Nazi Conspiracy, III, 459). Two subsequent decrees of October, 1939, and April, 1940, established special jurisdiction in general matters for all SS members (ibid., II, 184). From then on all pamphlets issued by the SS indoctrination office carry such notations as “Solely for use of the police,” “Not for publication,” “Exclusively for leaders and those entrusted with ideological education.” It would be worth while to compile a bibliography of the voluminous secret literature, which includes a great many legislative measures, that was printed during the Nazi era. Interestingly enough, there is not a single SA booklet among this type of literature, and this is probably the most conclusive proof that after 1934 the SA ceased to be an elite formation.

80 Hitler contemplated during the war the introduction of a National Health Bill: “After national X-ray examination, the Fuehrer is to be given a list of sick persons, particularly those with lung and heart diseases. On the basis of the new Reich Health Law . . . these families will no longer be able to remain among the public and can no longer be allowed to produce children. What will happen to these families will be the subject of further orders of the Fuehrer.” It does not need much imagination to guess what these further orders would have been. The number of people no longer allowed “to remain among the public” would have formed a considerable portion of the German population (Nazi Conspiracy, VI, 175).

81 The total number of Russian dead in four years of war is estimated at between 12 and 21 million. Stalin exterminated in a single year in the Ukraine alone about 8 million people (estimate). See Communism in Action. U. S. Government. Washington, 1946, House Document No. 754, pp. 140-141.—Unlike the Nazi regime which kept rather accurate accounts on the number of its victims, there are no reliable figures for the millions of people who were killed in the Russian system. Nevertheless the following estimate, quoted by Souvarine, op. cit., p. 669, carries some weight insofar as it stems from Walter Krivitsky, who had direct access to the information contained in the GPU files. According to these figures the census of 1937 in the Soviet Union, which Soviet statisticians had expected to reach 171 million persons, showed that there were actually only 145 millions. This would point to a loss in population of 26 millions, a figure which does not include the losses quoted above.

83 B. Souvarine, op. cit., p. 605, quotes Stalin as saying at the height of terror in 1937: “You must reach the understanding that of all the precious assets existing in the world, the most precious and decisive are the cadres.” All reports show that in Soviet Russia the secret police must be regarded as the real elite formation of the party. Characteristic for this nature of the police is that since the early twenties NKVD agents were “not recruited on a voluntary basis,” but drawn from the ranks of the party. Furthermore, “the NKVD could not be chosen as a career” (see Beck and Godin, op. cit., p. 160).

86 Hitler frequently commented on the relationship between state and party, and always emphasized that not the state, but the race, or the “united folk community,” was of primary importance (cf. the afore-quoted speech, reprinted as annex to the Tischgespräche). In his speech at the Nuremberg Parteitag of 1935, he gave this theory its most succinct expression: “It is not the state that commands us, but we who command the state.” It is self-evident that, in practice, such powers of command are possible only if the institutions of the party remain independent from those of the state.

86a Otto Gauweiler, Rechtseinrichtungen and Rechtsaufgaben der Bewegung, 1939, notes expressly that Himmler’s special position as Reichsfuehrer-SS and head of the German police rested on the fact that the police administration had achieved “a genuine unity of party and state” which was not even attempted anywhere else in the government.

91 Maurice Laporte, Histoire de VOkhrana, Paris, 1935, rightly called the method of provocation “the foundation stone” of the secret police (p. 19).

In Soviet Russia, provocation, far from being the secret weapon of the secret police, has been used as the widely propagandized public method of the regime to gauge the temper of public opinion. The reluctance of the population to avail itself of the periodically recurring invitations to criticize or react to “liberal” interludes in the terror regime shows that such gestures are understood as provocation on a mass scale. Provocation has indeed become the totalitarian version of public opinion polls.

92 Interesting in this respect are the attempts made by Nazi civil servants in Germany to reduce the competence and the personnel of the Gestapo on the ground that Nazification of the country had been achieved, so that Himmler, who on the contrary wanted to expand the secret services at this moment (around 1934), had to exaggerate the danger coming from the “internal enemies.” See Nazi Conspiracy, II, 259; V, 205; 111, 547.

94 It seems, after all, no accident that the foundation of the Okhrana in 1880 ushered in a period of unsurpassed revolutionary activities in Russia. In order to prove its usefulness, it had occasionally to organize murders, and its agents “served despite themselves the ideas of those whom they denounced. . . . If a pamphlet was distributed by a police agent or if the execution of a minister was organized by an Azev—the result was the same” (M. Laporte, op. cit., p. 25). The more important executions moreover seem to have been police jobs—Stolypin and von Plehve. Decisive for the revolutionary tradition was the fact that in times of calm the police agents had to “stir up anew the energies and stimulate the zeal” of the revolutionaries (ibid., p. 71).

95 Hans Frank, who later became Governor General of Poland, made a typical differentiation between a person “dangerous to the State” and a person who is “hostile to the State.” The former implies an objective quality which is independent of will and behavior; the political police of the Nazis is concerned not just with actions hostile Co the state but with “all attempts—no matter what their aim—which in their effects endanger the State.” See Deutsches Verwaltungsrecht, pp. 420-430. Translation quoted from Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 881 ff.—In the words of Maunz, op. cit., p. 44: “By eliminating dangerous persons, the security measure . . . means to ward off a state of danger to the national community, independently of any offense that may have been committed by these persons. [It is a question of] warding off an objective danger.”

96 R.

97 As early as 1941, during a staff meeting in Hitler’s headquarters, it was proposed to impose upon the Polish population those regulations by which the Jews had been prepared for the extermination camps: change of names if these were of German origin; death sentences for sexual intercourse between Germans and Poles (Rassenschande); obligation to wear a P-sign in Germany similar to the Yellow Star for Jews. See Nazi Conspiracy, VIII, 237 ff., and Hans Frank’s diary in Trial, op. cit., XXIX, 683.

98 Beck and Codin, op. cit., p. 87. speak of the “objective characteristics” which invited arrest in the USSR; among them was membership in the NKVD (p. 153). Subjective insight into the objective necessity of arrest and confession could most easily be achieved with former members of the secret police. In the words of an ex-NKVD agent: “My superiors know me and my work well enough, and if the party and the NKVD now require me to confess to such things they must have good reasons for what they are doing. My duty as a loyal Soviet citizen is not to withhold the confession required of me” (ibid., p. 231).

The Okhrana . . . will inform the Czar only of what it chooses to.”

101 Typical of the concept of the suspect is the following story related by C. Pobyedonostzev in L’Autocratie Russe: Mémoires politiques, correspondence officiele et documents inédits . . . 1881-1894, Paris, 1927: General Cherevin of the Okhrana is asked, because the opposing party has hired a Jewish lawyer, to intervene in favor of a lady who is about to lose a lawsuit. Says the General: “The same night I ordered the arrest of this cursed Jew and held him as a so-called politically suspect person. . . . After all, could I treat in the same manner friends and a dirty Jew who may be innocent today but who was guilty yesterday or will be guilty tomorrow?”

102 The charges in the Moscow Trials “were based . . . on a grotesquely brutalized and distorting anticipation of possible developments. [Stalin’s] reasoning probably developed along the following lines: they may want to overthrow me in a crisis—I shall charge them with having made the attempt. . . . A change of government may weaken Russia’s fighting capacity; and if they succeed, they may be compelled to sign a truce with Hitler, and perhaps even agree to a cession of territory. . . . I shall accuse them of having entered already into a treacherous alliance with Germany and ceded Soviet territory.” This is I. Deutscher’s brilliant explanation of the Moscow Trials, op. cit., p. 377.

A good example of the Nazi version of the possible crime can be found in Hans Frank, op. cit.: “A complete catalogue of attempts ‘dangerous to the State’ can never be drawn up because it can never be foreseen what may endanger the leadership and the people some time in the future.” (Translation quoted from Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 881.)

103 The criminal methods of the secret police are of course no monopoly of the French tradition.

See Wolfson, op. cit., letter of September 19, 1941, from Oswald Pohl, head of the WVH (Wirtschafts-und Verwaltungs-Hauptamt) to the Reichskommissar for price control. It seems that all these economic activities in the concentration camps developed only during the war and under the pressure of acute labor shortage.

110 “Bek Bulat (the pen name of a former Soviet professor) has been able to study documents of the North Caucasian NKVD. From these documents it was obvious that in June, 1937, when the great purge was at its apex, the government prescribed the local NKVDs to have a certain percentage of the population arrested. . . . The percentage varied from one province to the other, reaching 5 per cent in the least loyal areas. The average for the whole of the Soviet Union was about 3 per cent.” Reported by David J. Dallin in The New Leader, January 8, 1949.—Beck and Godin, op. cit., p. 239, arrive at a slightly divergent and quite plausible assumption, according to which “arrests were planned as follows: The NKVD files covered practically the whole population, and everyone was classified in a category. Thus statistics were available in every town showing how many former Whites, members of opposing parties, etc., were living in them. All incriminating material collected . . . and gathered from prisoners’ confessions was also entered in the files, and each person’s card was marked to show how dangerous he was considered; this depending on the amount of suspicious or incriminating material appearing in his file. As the statistics were regularly reported to higher authorities, it was possible to arrange a purge at any moment, with full knowledge of the exact number of persons in each category.”

112 The Russian secret-police cadres were as much at the “personal disposal” of Stalin as the SS Shock Troops (Verfügungstruppen) were at the personal disposal of Hitler. Both, even if they are called to serve with the military forces in time of war, live under their own special jurisdiction. The special “marriage laws” which served to segregate the SS from the rest of the population, were the first and most fundamental regulations which Himmler introduced when he took over the reorganization of the SS. Even prior to Himmler’s marriage laws, in 1927, the SS was instructed by official decree “never [to participate] in discussions at membership meetings” (Der Weg der SS, op. cit.). The same conduct is reported about the members of the NKVD, who kept deliberately to themselves and above all did not associate with other sections of the party aristocracy (Beck and Godin, op. cit., p. 163).

124 The Nazis were well aware of the protective wall of incredulity which surrounded their enterprise. A secret report to Rosenberg about the massacre of 5,000 Jews in 1943 states explicitly: “Imagine only that these occurrences would become known to the other side and exploited by them. Most likely such propaganda would have no effect only because people who hear and read about it simply would not be ready to believe it” (Nazi Conspiracy, I, 1001).

For Soviet concentration camps, see the excellent collection of reports by Polish survivors published under the title The Dark Side of the Moon; also David J.

128 See especially Bruno Bettelheim, op. cit. “It seemed as if I had become convinced that these horrible and degrading experiences somehow did not happen to ‘me’ as subject but to ‘me’ as an object. This experience was corroborated by the statements of other prisoners. . . . it was as if I watched things happening in which I only vaguely participated. . . . This cannot be true, such things just do not happen.’ . . . The prisoners had to convince themselves that this was real, was really happening and not just a nightmare. They were never wholly successful.”

See also Rousset, op. cit., p. 213. “. . . Those who haven’t seen it with their own eyes can’t believe it. Did you yourself, before you came here, take the rumors about the gas chambers seriously?

“No, I said.

134 This happened in Germany toward the end of 1942, whereupon Himmler served notice to all camp commandants “to reduce the death rate at all costs.” For it had turned out that of the 136,000 new arrivals, 70,000 were already dead on reaching the camp or died immediately thereafter. See Nazi Conspiracy, IV, Annex II.—Later reports from Soviet Russian camps unanimously confirm that after 1949—that is, when Stalin was still alive—the death rate in the concentration camps, which previously had reached up to 60 per cent of the inmates, was systematically lowered, presumably due to a general and acute labor shortage in the Soviet Union. This improvement in living conditions should not be confused with the crisis of the regime after Stalin’s death which, characteristically enough, first made itself felt in the concentration camps. Cf. Wilhelm Starlinger, Grenzen der Sowjetmacht, Würzburg, 1955.

135 See Kogon, op. cit., p. 58: “A large pari of the work exacted in the concentration camps was useless, either it was superfluous or it was so miserably planned that it had to be done over two or three times.” Also Bettelheim, op. cit., pp. 831-32: “New prisoners particularly were forced to perform nonsensical tasks. . . . They felt debased . . . and preferred even harder work when it produced something useful. . . .” Even Dallin, who has built his whole book on the thesis that the purpose of Russian camps is to provide cheap labor, is forced to admit the inefficiency of camp labor, op. cit., p. 105.—The current theories about the Russian camp system as an economic measure for providing a cheap labor supply would stand clearly refuted if recent reports on mass amnesties and the abolition of concentration camps should prove to be true. For if the camps had served an important economic purpose, the regime certainly could not have afforded their rapid liquidation without grave consequences for the whole economic system.

136 Apart from the millions of people whom the Nazis transported to the extermination camps, they constantly attempted new colonization plans—transported Germans from Germany or the occupied territories to the East for colonization purposes. This was of course a serious handicap for military actions and economic exploitation. For the numerous discussions on these subjects and the constant conflict between the Nazi civilian hierarchy in the Eastern occupied territories and the SS hierarchy see especially Vol. XXIX of Trial of the Major War Criminals, Nuremberg, 1947.

138 It is of some importance to realize that all pictures of concentration camps are misleading insofar as they show the camps in their last stages, at the moment the Allied troops marched in. There were no death camps in Germany proper, and at that point all extermination equipment had already been dismantled. On the other hand, what provoked the outrage of the Allies most and what gives the films their special horror—namely, the sight of the human skeletons—was not at all typical for the German concentration camps; extermination was handled systematically by gas, not by starvation. The condition of the camps was a result of the war events during the final months: Himmler had ordered the evacuation of all extermination camps in the East, the German camps were consequently vastly overcrowded, and he was no longer in a position to assure the food supply in Germany.

142 “Gestapo and SS have always attached great importance to mixing the categories of inmates in the camps. In no camp have the inmates belonged exclusively to one category” (Kogon, op. cit., p. 19).

In Russia, it has also been customary from the beginning to mix political prisoners and criminals. During the first ten years of Soviet power, the Left political groups enjoyed certain privileges; only with the full development of the totalitarian character of the regime “after the end of the twenties, the politicals were even officially treated as inferior to the common criminals” (Dallin, op. cit., p. 177 ff.).

159 Kogon, op. cit., p. 6, speaks of the possibility that the camps will be maintained as training and experimental grounds for the SS. He also gives a good report on the difference between the early camps administered by the SA and the later ones under the SS. “None of these first camps had more than a thousand inmates. . . . Life in them beggared all description. The accounts of the few old prisoners who survived those years agree that there was scarcely any form of sadistic perversion that was not practiced by the SA men. But they were all acts of individual bestiality, there was still no fully organized cold system, embracing masses of men. This was the accomplishment of the SS” (p. 7).

This new mechanized system eased the feeling of responsibility as much as was humanly possible. When, for instance, the order came to kill every day several hundred Russian prisoners, the slaughter was performed by shooting through a hole without seeing the victim. (See Ernest Feder, “Essai sur la Psychologie de la Terreur,” in Syntheses, Brussels, 1946.) On the other hand, perversion was artificially produced in otherwise normal men. Rousset reports the following from a SS guard: “Usually I keep on hitting until I ejaculate. I have a wife and three children in Breslau. I used to be perfectly normal. That’s what they’ve made of me. Now when they give me a pass out of here, I don’t go home. I don’t dare look my wife in the face” (p. 273).—The documents from the Hitler era contain numerous testimonials for the average normality of those entrusted with carrying out Hitler’s program of extermination. A good collection is found in Leon Poliakov’s “The Weapon of Antisemitism,” published by UNESCO in The Third Reich, London, 1955. Most of the men in the units used for these purposes were not volunteers but had been drafted from the ordinary police for these special assignments. But even trained SS-men found this kind of duty worse than front-line fighting. In his report of a mass execution by the SS, an eyewitness gives high praise to this troop which had been so “idealistic” that it was able to bear “the entire extermination without the help of liquor.”

That one wanted to eliminate all personal motives and passions during the “exterminations” and hence keep the cruelties to a minimum is revealed by the fact that a group of doctors and engineers entrusted with handling the gas installations were making constant improvements that were not only designed to raise the productive capacity of the corpse factories but also to accelerate and ease the agony of death.

160 This is very prominent in Rousset’s work. “The social conditions of life in the camps have transformed the great mass of inmates, both the Germans and the deportees, regardless of their previous social position and education . . . into a degenerate rabble, entirely submissive to the primitive reflexes of the animal instinct” (p. 183).

161 In this context also belongs the astonishing rarety of suicides in the camps. Suicide occurred far more often before arrest and deportation than in the camp itself, which is of course partly explained by the fact that every attempt was made to prevent suicides which are, after all, spontaneous acts. From the statistical material for Buchenwald (Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 800 ff.) it is evident that scarcely more than one-half per cent of the deaths could be traced to suicide, that frequently there were only two suicides per year, although in the same year the total number of deaths reached 3,516. The reports from Russian camps mention the same phenomenon. Cf,. for instance. Starlinger, op. cit., p. 57.
